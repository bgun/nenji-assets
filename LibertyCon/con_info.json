Any spot in my school notebooks that didn&#039;t have notes were filled with sketches. I drew mostly from the D&D adventures that my brother ran, as well as the fantasy books I was reading. I did a few pieces based on Terry Brooks&#039; Shannara series, but focusing on being a nerd, I didn&#039;t have much time for art in high school.\nWhen I got to college I dual majored in Computer Science and Art History. I minored in Studio Art, and took as many art classes as my schedule allowed. I seemed to be pursuing a career in art or art education, but decided to try graduate school in Computer Science. I graduated in 2004 with a Master&#039;s in CS, but again switched paths and returned to my art interests. Mike, my brother, and I co-own Aradani Studios, a costuming and art company that we founded in 2002. We travel mostly in the Southeast United States, to various conventions and Renaissance Festivals, selling our art, and our ears.\nI currently call Nashville, TN my home, and don&#039;t see that changing for quite some time. This is where my friends, my family, and my career is. When I first posted this bio, I said that, &quot;I still have no idea what I want to do with my life.&quot; Well, in those 4 years that I wrote that, I think I have found my calling. At the age of 26, I won the most prestigious fantasy art award there is, the Chesley Award. Mike and I have slowly but steadily grown this business into something that now employees other people! And most importantly, I love what I do, and I truly enjoy being able to talk about my art with people, and have a dialogue with them.&quot;\n",

For example: hosting educational Scotch tastings at conventions, consulting for numerous authors on matters pharmaceutical, biological, and neurological; and writing nonfiction essays (as Tedd Roberts and now under his own name; found at WWW.BAEN.COM - Free Library, Nonfiction 2012- 2018) on matters of science in science fiction. He educates others through convention appearances, his previously mentioned essays and blog. Among all of these endeavors he has also mentored numerous young minds through his involvement with the Boy Scouts of America and by offering advice to up and coming researchers and grad students. \n\nDr. Hampson is also known for his research, and due to this, is suspected to be one of the most likely causes of any future zombie apocalypse ... whether it would be because of a lab \"accident\" or because his curiosity on its effectiveness, is still hotly debated. Simultaneously, his professional alter ego has been considered to be one of the most likely to find a cure for any zombie apocalypse, although some suspect he already has one waiting \"just in case.\" In either (or both) cases it is suspected that Speaker will also be available to provide expert commentary.\n\nKnown for his high level of involvement in many activities, some suspect that Speaker has either cloned himself, or developed a treatment allowing him to no longer require sleep. Unhappy with his low level of productiveness (compared to the other personalities, not normal humans) he recently started writing short stories and YA novels. Amongst his three busy lives he found time to marry and help raise two sons, study Krav Maga & Pekiti Tiersia Kali, play trombone in a brass octet, and be an active member of his church.\n",

      "name": "Wilson 'Bob' Tucker",
      "bio": "(1914-2006)\nUS writer, orphaned, brought up in Bloomington and Normal, Illinois, where he set some of his fiction, some early stories being signed Bob Tucker. For several decades he worked as a film projectionist, retiring in 1972, and he always spoke of his writing - more than twenty books, half of them sf, half of them mysteries - as an avocation. Tucker began his involvement with sf about 1932, and during the 1930s was exceedingly active as a fan and Fanzine publisher, starting with The Planetoid in 1932, though his most notable fanzine was Le Zombie, which lasted for 67 issues 1938-1975, the first half-decade of that period being its heyday; his The Neo-Fan&#039;s Guide (1955 chap; rev 1973 chap; rev 1984 chap) demonstrates the quality of this work. As an example of the violent humour and intense emotions aroused in early Fandom, it is notable that Tucker was twice subjected to hoax obituaries in the sf magazines of the time. His fanzine The Bloomington News Letter (later Science Fiction News Letter) dealt mainly with the professional field.\nWhile active as a fan Tucker was also writing fiction, though not until May 1941 did he publish his first story, &quot;Interstellar Way-Station&quot; as by Bob Tucker, in Super Science Novels (> Super Science Stories). He never became prolific in shorter forms - The Best of Wilson Tucker (coll 1982) contains most of his better work - soon turning to novels. His first, The Chinese Doll (1946), was a mystery, but made Recursive use of the world of sf fandom, initiating his lifelong habit, which pleased the knowledgeable fans, while irritating some critics, of using the names of fans and writers for the characters of his books; these names became known as Tuckerisms (> also Fan Language). His first sf novel, The City in the Sea (1951), deals somewhat crudely with material similar to that treated far more effectively in the much later Ice and Iron (1974; exp 1975); in both, a matriarchal culture begins to re-invade a USA reverted to savagery, but in the latter the far-future matriarchy is linked through Time Travel to an America, only generations hence, in the grip of a new ice age caused by Climate Change. This latter tale is not perhaps very coherently told, but the panoramas are lucid. Time travel is central to much of Tucker&#039;s work, featuring in tales like The Lincoln Hunters (1958), one of his best novels, in which time travellers from an imperial USA several hundred years hence are sent to acquire a recording of a lost speech of Abraham Lincoln (> Icons); the two cultures are effectively contrasted. The ending, in which the protagonist is trapped in an 1856 far less unattractive than the future from which he came, is both poignant and welcome. In the Time Masters sequence, comprising The Time Masters (1953; rev 1971) and Time Bomb (1955; vt Tomorrow Plus X 1957), two long-lived extraterrestrials&#039; presence throughout human history as opposed Superman-like Secret Masters generates some of the same perspectives as time travel itself; throughout, sexual chauvinism is treated as a curse (> Women in SF).\nTucker had a knack of choosing unusually resonant and appropriate titles for his novels. Examples are The Long Loud Silence (1952; rev 1970; early US editions delete implications of cannibalism, UK editions do not), and The Year of the Quiet Sun (1970). The former is a powerful tale, set in Ruined Earth territory west of the Mississippi River, sombre and tough in feeling, though at points awkwardly told; the hero, unusually for a Genre-SF novel, is in many ways cruel and insensitive. The latter, which won a John W Campbell Memorial Award retrospectively in 1976, sends its black protagonist forwards in time to around 2020 AD, where he finds America in dire shape, his blackness terrifying to the racially divided remnants of the civil war which has ended civilization. The prophecy that he had discovered in a non-Biblical ancient manuscript is fulfilled: there is to be a Year of the Quiet Sun. He prepares to watch the final rites of history that signal the End of the World.\nTucker was a very uneven writer, but expanded the boundaries of genre sf with his downbeat and realistic variations on old material, and demonstrated how effective a generic Cliche like Time Travel could become when treated with due attention. By tying his use of time travel to virtual archaeologies of the worlds thus exposed, he transformed that Cliche into an instrument of vision. He became inactive in the professional sf field after about 1980, though remaining a genial presence in Fandom and even reviving Le Zombie as the online e-Zombie (2000-2001), continuing the earlier numbering from #68 to #72. In 1996 he was honoured by SFWA as Author Emeritus (> SFWA Grand Master Award), and was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2003.

      "guest_id": "guest48",
      "name": "A. E. van Vogt",
      "bio": "(1912-2000) Canadian writer who moved to the USA at the end of 1944 after establishing his name as one of the creators of John W Campbell Jr&#039;s Golden Age of SF with a flood of material in Astounding Science-Fiction, starting with &quot;Black Destroyer&quot; (July 1939 Astounding), though he had been active for several years in various other genres. Van Vogt was the first Canadian sf writer of real importance, and it is arguable that a Canadian solitudinousness colours his work throughout; it is certainly the case that he wrote very few tales involving the penetration of frontiers after the American pattern. The many Space Opera empires in his work generally pre-exist the tales that describe them, and are conquered from within. At a rough estimate (including stockpiled tales published later) Van Vogt wrote at least fifty stories and four novels in Canada before emigrating with E Mayne Hull, whom he had married in 1939. There remains some doubt as to how much she contributed to her collaborations with Van Vogt, and even her solo works have been speculatively credited to her husband. In any case, her active career ceased in 1950 with her conversion to L Ron Hubbard&#039;s Dianetics. Van Vogt also converted, becoming virtually silent for several years, publishing no new stories until 1963, after which date he entered a second period of high productivity. His late works have generally, however, been disregarded in any assessment of his importance to the field.\nIn 1939-1947 van Vogt published at least thirty-five sf stories in Astounding alone, some of novel length, and it was the work of these years, much of it not to be published in book form until long afterwards in reconstructed versions, that gave him his high reputation as a master of intricate, metaphysical Space Opera. Along with Isaac Asimov and Robert A Heinlein, and to a lesser extent L Sprague de Camp and L Ron Hubbard - he seemed nearly to create, by writing what Campbell wanted to publish, the first genuinely successful period of US sf; only in this &quot;Golden Age&quot; did it begin to achieve, in literary terms, what the writers of US Genre SF had eschewed 20 years earlier when they had found that Pulp magazines not only wished to publish sf but were their only consistent market. Although van Vogt catered for the pulps, he intensified the emotional impact and complexity of the stories they would bear: his nearly invincible alien Monsters, the long timespans of his tales, the Time Paradoxes that fill them, the quasimessianic Supermen who come into their own as the stories progress, the Galactic Empires they tend to rule and the states of lonely transcendental omnipotence they tend to achieve - all are presented in a prose that uses crude, dark colours but whose striking Sense of Wonder is conveyed with a dreamlike conviction. The abrupt complications of plot for which he became so well known, and which have been so scathingly mocked for their illogic and preposterousness - within narratives that claimed to be presenting higher forms of logic to the reader - are best analysed, and their effects best understood, when their sudden shifts of perspective and rationale and scale are seen as analogous to the movements of a dream.\nIt is these &quot;Hard-SF dreams&quot;, so grippingly void of constraints or of the usual surrealistic appurtenances of dream literature, that have so haunted generations of children and adolescents; and many of his best stories convey more clearly than his novels the driven hauntedness central to Van Vogt. Although many of the stories published during the first decade of his career were later assembled into Fixups (see below), original versions can be found in collections like Out of the Unknown [for details of revs etc see Checklist] (coll 1948) with E Mayne Hull (see above), Destination: Universe! (coll 1952) and Away and Beyond [for details of revs etc see Checklist] (coll 1952). The earlier Masters of Time (coll 1950) - a volume comprising two stories later published separately as The Changeling (April 1944 Astounding; 1967) and Earth&#039;s Last Fortress (March 1942 Astounding as &quot;Recruiting Station&quot;; 1960 dos; vt Masters of Time 1967) - contains in the novella &quot;Recruiting Station&quot;, a genuine if primitively couched Changewar in which the victory of one side will mean the extinction of the other throughout history (> also Parallel Worlds; Time Loops). This long tale, plus twenty-four other early works, has been assembled as Transfinite: The Essential A E Van Vogt (coll 2003) ed Rick Katze and Joe Rico.\nVan Vogt&#039;s first novel, and perhaps still his best known, is Slan (September-December 1940 Astounding; 1946; rev 1951). Its Hero, the young Jommy Cross, is a member of a Mutant race, the Slans, a Pariah Elite long driven into hiding because of the jealousy of normals. Jommy&#039;s powers (> Children in SF), which include Telepathy, physical superiority to normals (he has two hearts) and extraordinary Intelligence, enable him to survive the mobbing, arrest and offstage death of his mother and to escape from sight into an adolescence and young manhood during which he begins to sense his true powers. As a man he becomes involved with Earth&#039;s mysterious dictator, with defective Slans, and with various intrigues centring on new sources of energy. Matters are cleared up only at the book&#039;s close with the revelation that the dictator is himself a secret Slan, that the girl Slan with whom Jommy is in love is the dictator&#039;s daughter, and that Jommy is in line for the succession. Slan is a much imitated model for the creation of wish-fulfilment stories. A follow-up tale based on an unknown amount of draft material from the end of Van Vogt&#039;s active career around 1984, Slan Hunter (December 2006-April 2007 Jim Baen&#039;s Universe; 2007) with Kevin J Anderson might almost be deemed a Sequel by Other Hands, and is very significantly less interesting. Slan & Slan Hunter (omni 2007) assembles the 1951 revision of Slan along with the later book.\nHowever, it was in the two Weapon Shops Time Operas - The Weapon Shops of Isher (July 1941 and December 1942 Astounding; February 1949 Thrilling Wonder; fixup 1951) and The Weapon Makers (February-April 1943 Astounding; dated 1947 but 1946; rev 1952; vt One Against Eternity 1955 dos), assembled as The Weapon Shops of Isher, and The Weapon Makers (omni 1988; vt The Empire of Isher 2000) - that van Vogt&#039;s mixture of hard-sf dreams, enormities of complication, and transcendent superheroes was most hypnotically presented. The main protagonist of the two books, the immortal Robert Hedrock (> Immortality; Secret Masters), has not only in the dim past created the Weapon Shops as a Libertarian force to counterbalance the imperial world government long dominant on Earth, but also turns out eventually to have literally begotten the race of emperors and empresses who rule that government in traditional opposition to the mysterious Shops, which are invulnerable and sell weapons to anyone. To cap this dream of omnipotence, Hedrock unwittingly passes a Galactic initiation test at the very end of the second book, a test designed by a Forerunner to select (> Uplift) the next rulers of the &quot;sevagram&quot;. The word &quot;sevagram&quot; appears only, as the very last word of The Weapon Makers; this resonantly mysterious Slingshot Ending, which seems to open universes to the reader&#039;s gaze, may well stand as the best working demonstration in the whole of genre sf of how to impart a Sense of Wonder.\nThe second major series of van Vogt&#039;s prolific decade - the Null-A sequence comprising The World of A (August-October 1945 Astounding; rev 1948; vt The World of Null-A 1953 dos; rev with intro 1970) and The Pawns of Null-A (October 1948-January 1949 Astounding as &quot;The Players of A&quot;; 1956; rev vt The Players of Null-A 1966), plus La Fin du A (1984; orig English text as Null-A Three 1985; vt Null A-3 1985) - may have appeared weightier in its attempts to present its arguments in terms of &quot;non-Aristotelian&quot; thought (> General Semantics), a claim which might seem ominously to prefigure a rationalization of the effortless dream logic of the earlier stories; but in the event tends to stumble into excessive tangles of complication, especially in the final volume, where the intense storyableness of Van Vogt&#039;s early work had dissipated by this late point in his career, and incoherence ruled. The protagonist Gosseyn (go sane), whose Psi Powers include Teleportation, lacks humour even more decidedly than his superman predecessors, and his rapid, confusing, nearly emotionless shifting from one Gosseyn body to another, in a kind of Identity Transfer between Clones but without the concept of cloning to sustain it, makes his eventual supremacy so peculiarly disorganized as to be almost without effect on the reader. By this time van Vogt was nearing the end of his association with Astounding, after an extraordinarily productive decade, and would soon stop writing entirely; perhaps The Pawns of Null-A, which in magazine form stretched to 100,000 words, was about as far as he could go without an extended breather. Certainly his third series from this period - the Clane sequence comprising Empire of the Atom (stories May 1946-December 1947 Astounding; fixup 1957; cut 1957 dos) and The Wizard of Linn (April-June 1950 Astounding; 1962) - is considerably less intense, though something of the effect of the original is recaptured in Transgalactic (omni 2006), which reprints the series in its magazine form. James Blish argued of this series about superscience and palace politics that its plot and characters closely resemble those of Robert Graves&#039;s Claudius novels: it would have been a brave critic who, with equal persuasiveness, found van Vogt&#039;s earlier series to resemble any previous work of world literature.\nThe Voyage of the Space Beagle (stories July 1939-August 1943 Astounding, May 1950 Other Worlds; fixup 1950; vt Mission: Interplanetary 1952) marshalled several early stories into a chronicle depicting various ways in which a &quot;Nexialist&quot;, Elliot Grosvenor, by using a response to Aliens and their environments that synthesizes different fields of knowledge, copes with First Contacts involving divers Monsters. The book incorporates van Vogt&#039;s first two sf stories; and Nexialism itself, which involves a system of intensive psychological training, symptomatically prefigures L Ron Hubbard&#039;s Dianetics, with which van Vogt was to become so closely involved. This involvement was the culmination of his persistent interest in all training systems which purport scientifically (or pseudoscientifically; > Pseudoscience) to create physical or mental superiority and awaken dormant talents, an interest which generated not only the three General-Semantics novels described above but also Siege of the Unseen (October-November 1946 Astounding as &quot;The Chronicler&quot;; 1959 dos; vt as title story in The Three Eyes of Evil coll 1973), in which, inspired by the Bates eye-exercise system, he dramatized the curing of eye problems through partly mental means. Though described in less detail, the Dellian mind techniques invoked in The Mixed Men (stories September 1943-January 1945 Astounding; fixup 1952; cut vt Mission to the Stars 1955) are of the same ilk.\nDuring this first decade of his career, van Vogt also contributed material also to Astounding&#039;s sister magazine, Unknown, most notably The Book of Ptath (October 1943 Unknown; 1947; vt Two Hundred Million A.D. 1964; vt Ptath 1976), a Far-Future epic in which a reincarnated but Amnesiac god-figure must fight and overcome a She-like usurper to re-establish his suzerainty. The distinction in Van Vogt between an sf and a fantasy Superman is not perhaps great; but it is the case that he rarely wrote in the latter genre.\nIn Reflections of A.E. van Vogt: The Autobiography of a Science Fiction Giant, with a Complete Bibliography (1975), van Vogt uses the term &quot;fix-up&quot; (or Fixup) in the sense which we have adopted for this encyclopedia: a book made up of previously published stories altered to fit together - usually with the addition of new cementing material - the end product being marketed as a novel. It is possible that van Vogt invented the term for, although fixups are not unknown outside sf, the peculiar marketing circumstances of the genre in the USA encouraged their creation, and certainly van Vogt wrote (or compiled) more fixups than any other sf writer of stature. It was during his time of relative inactivity as a creator of original material - the 1950s and early 1960s - that he began producing these numerous fixups, including titles already mentioned (see above). Further fixups incorporating Golden-Age material include The War Against the Rull (stories April 1940-February 1950 Astounding; fixup 1959), The Beast (stories July 1943-April 1944 Astounding; fixup 1963; vt Moonbeast 1969) and Quest for the Future (stories January 1943-July 1946 Astounding; fixup 1970).\nThe Silkie (stories July 1964-October 1967 If; fixup 1969), though technically similar, was the first to use substantially contemporary material - and may have been the first whose component parts were all written with the end result in mind. It signalled the beginning of van Vogt&#039;s second period of productivity, with Children of Tomorrow (1970) being his first completely new sf novel since The Mind Cage (1948 Fantasy Book #3 as &quot;The Great Judge&quot;; much exp 1957) - although he had also published The Violent Man (1962), a political thriller about the attempted brainwashing of Westerners in contemporary communist China. The most sustained effort of this second wave of titles was perhaps The Battle of Forever (1971), in which the enhanced-human protagonist, Modyun, leaves the Keep where his kind had for aeons dwelt in seclusion and undertakes a Far-Future odyssey through a decadent world and Galaxy, battling against aliens and gradually coming to full stature as a Superman. Compared to the fixups of the previous decade or so, the story is well paced and emotionally coherent, though the oneiric flow of arousing event and imagery is damaged by a sense of self-consciousness. Further novels do not live up to this promise of partial renewal, and were not well received.\nCritics such as Damon Knight - in an extended review (1945 Destiny&#039;s Child; exp in In Search of Wonder, coll 1956; rev 1967) - have tended to treat the typical van Vogt tale as a failed effort at hard sf, and have consequently tended to describe stories others have written in the modes he developed - like Philip K Dick, Charles L Harness and Larry Niven - as &quot;improvements&quot; on the original model. In some ways, of course, these writers have built upon the complexity of van Vogt&#039;s worlds and have significantly rationalized his convulsive shuffling and reshuffling of every element of his stories, but without knowing how to convey the deeply Canadian whited-out wilderness venues, so typical of his work, that in their very absence of human detail impart a chthonic frisson to otherwise jumbled plotlines. Thus freed of any surface verisimilitude, Van Vogt&#039;s space operas, as noted, are at heart enacted dreams which articulate deep, symbolic needs and wishes of his readership. Because there is no misunderstood science or cosmography or technology at the very heart of his best work, there is no &quot;improving&quot; van Vogt. In 1995 he received the SFWA Grand Master Award; he was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame on its inauguration in 1996.

      "bio": "(1941-2010)\nUK-born systems-design engineer and writer, in the USA from 1977 and latterly in Ireland; he was a full-time author from 1979. His first novel (and first publication), Inherit the Stars (1977), aroused interest for the exhilarating sense it conveys of scientific minds at work on real problems and for the genuinely exciting scope of the sf imagination it deploys. The book turned out to be the first volume in the Minervan Experiment/Giants sequence, being followed by The Gentle Giants of Ganymede (1978), both assembled as The Two Moons (omni 2006), plus Giants&#039; Star (1981), all three assembled as The Minervan Experiment (omni 1981; vt The Giants Omnibus 1991); the series was continued with Entoverse (1991), a tale that laboriously expands the initial premise through the use of a Parallel World in which, rather oddly for a writer pugnaciously associated with the Hard-SF wing of the genre, only Magic can cope with the strangeness of the physical world - in the earlier volumes of the sequence the reader was safely in the hands of an author who brooked no such nonsense. This willingness on Hogan&#039;s part to re-activate sequences that had come to a natural halt generated a further sequel to the Minervan Experiment/Giants series: Mission to Minerva (2005), assembled with Entoverse as The Two Worlds (omni 2007), which features Time Travel back to a period before the original sequence began, and the creation of an Alternate History that side-steps the earlier closure. The original sequence is in fact a Hard-SF fable of humanity&#039;s origins - we are the direct descendants of a highly aggressive Forerunner species that had inhabited the destroyed fifth planet, and would have conquered the Galaxy had they not blown themselves up - and espouses a vision of the Universe in which other species must learn to cope with the knowledge that we will, some day, come into our inheritance. Although Hogan&#039;s later attempted rescue of the fifth world from Disaster may not fully satisfy, the sequence as a whole remains his best work.\nOther novels variously succeed in presenting Heroes - generally clumped into male-bonded affinity groups - and scientific problems of a similar nature. In The Genesis Machine (1978) one of these heroes averts the End of the World. In Voyage from Yesteryear (1982) a colony world, governed according to the kind of Trickster Libertarianism of old and honoured Astounding writers like Eric Frank Russell (> Colonization of Other Worlds), effortlessly faces down and flummoxes, with the assistance of wise Robots and hidden Weapons, an attempt by Earth to re-establish control. This Libertarian SF novel won a Prometheus Award. In Code of the Lifemaker (1983) a Robot civilization on Titan is saved from similarly corrupt Earth corporations; there are entertaining sidelights on Earthly Pseudoscience and robotic Evolution and Religion.\nBut in Endgame Enigma (1987) a Near-Future Russian threat to dominate the world via armed satellite is recounted with leaden flippancy, and this brought to the fore a problem Hogan had presented to his readers from the first. Though most of them either shared or accepted his right-wing Politics, and (at least in the first half of his career) tolerated editorial animadversions addressed to personal betes-noires like the Ecology movement, Hogan&#039;s awkwardness as a stylist and creator of character made his books difficult, at times, actually to read. When he abandoned his strengths - his hard-edged sense of how Scientists think, and his joyful capacity to stretch the terms of Space Opera - this gaucheness was difficult to ignore - especially in his later years when his contrarian instincts led him in various directions, sometimes in defence of civil liberties, sometimes into favourable comments on Holocaust Denial as a form of scepticism. On the other hand, a later tale like Echoes of an Alien Sky (2007), though its protagonists were still Talking Heads, imparted a sense of gravitas to its depiction of a Ruined Earth and of the Time Abyss between the present tense of the novel and any world its readers might hope will survive.

      "bio": "David Cherry&#039;s first Artist Guest of Honor spot was at a ChattaCon at The Read House, presided over by Tim Bolgeo, almost 30 years ago.  He is honored to appear at LibertyCon this year with his daughter, Kassandra,  as Special Guests.  This time with Brandy presiding.  David has been many things over the years, but the terms artist and illustrator describe him best.  Career-wise, that is where his heart is.  \r\nDavid started out in life as an attorney in Oklahoma.   Seven years later he had had enough of arguing every day with people who were paid to disagree with him.  So, he taught himself how to paint and began a career as an illustrator, specializing in fantasy and science fiction.    For the next 18 years he did book covers, magazine covers, book interiors, calendars, game cards [Magic: The Gathering, Dune, Lord of the Rings, Wheel of Time, etc.], collectible plate designs, and established himself as one of the top artists in his field.  He was AGOH at several cons each year,  won just about every major award available to sf illustrators, served twice as President of the Association of Science Fiction and Fantasy Artists, and was honored to present a slideshow of his work to The Fellows of The Smithsonian.  The one award that eluded him was the Hugo for Best Professional Artist.  He was closing in on it (largely due to the support of fans and friends in Chattanooga and Atlanta) when life took another turn and he ended up leaving freelance illustration to become Senior Concept Artist and, later, Marketing Artist for Ensemble Studios, a game developer in Dallas, Texas.  For the next 9 years, he worked in the game industry, helping to ship titles such as Age of Mythology, Age of Empires III, and Halo Wars.  He became proficient at digital art, both 2D and 3D.  Then, in 2009, when Ensemble closed its doors, David became Professor Cherry at The Guildhall at SMU, a graduate school for people who want to work in the game development industry.  There, he became head of the Art Department, rewrote the Art curriculum from top to bottom, and was head of the Masters Degree program for all artists.  \r\nSo.  He has been in Texas, and he has been busy.  But all that time, he wanted two things: to get back to Oklahoma and to get back to freelance illustration.  In 2013 he moved to Norman, Oklahoma, bought a nice house with a koi pond, and set about redesigning his life to get back into freelance art.  So.  Life has taken him full circle.  But this time things are a bit different.  Now he has a partner:  his daughter, Kassandra Leigh Cherry.  She is attending The University of Oklahoma in Norman, majoring in Italian and Japanese.  But her real goal in life is to become an artist like her Dad and a writer like her Aunt Carolyn (renowned author, C.J. Cherryh).  Just like her father, so many years ago, her first appearance as a guest is in Chattanooga.  She is still a student, still has much to learn.  But we know she has a great career ahead of her.  Years from now she will look back on this convention as the start of it all.  That is how these things work.  \r\nDavid and Kassandra are nice people.  Please welcome them and get to know them.\r\n",

      "name": "L. Sprague de Camp",
      "bio": "(1907-2000)\nUS writer, married from 1939 until her death early in 2000 to Catherine Adelaide Crook (> Catherine Crook de Camp), who collaborated on a number of his books, sometimes without printed credit, though always freely acknowledged by de Camp; though she was always actively involved in his career, the two were increasingly seen after about 1960 to be genuine collaborators. De Camp was educated at the California Institute of Technology, where he studied aeronautical engineering, and at Stevens Institute of Technology, where he gained a master&#039;s degree in 1933. He went to work for a company dealing with patenting, and his first published work was a co-written textbook on the subject. He then met P Schuyler Miller, with whom he collaborated on a novel, which failed to find a publisher for several years: Genus Homo (March 1941 Super Science Stories; exp 1950), signed by both authors, is a Sleepers Awake tale whose protagonists find that, a million years hence, the human species has been supplanted by apes (> Apes as Human, Satire). De Camp&#039;s first published story was &quot;The Isolinguals&quot; (September 1937 Astounding), which appeared before the arrival of John W Campbell Jr as Astounding editor; but when that happened the two men proved highly compatible, and de Camp soon became a central figure of the Golden Age of SF, writing prolifically for Astounding over the next few years (on one occasion using the pseudonym Lyman R Lyon). His contributions included the Johnny Black series about an intelligent, Uplifted bear: &quot;The Command&quot; (October 1938 Astounding), &quot;The Incorrigible&quot; (January 1939 Astounding), &quot;The Emancipated&quot; (March 1940 Astounding) and &quot;The Exhalted&quot; (November 1940 Astounding). Some of the better stories from this period were collected in The Best of L. Sprague de Camp (coll 1978).\nIt was, however, the appearance in 1939 of Astounding&#039;s fantasy companion Unknown which stimulated de Camp&#039;s most notable early work, including Lest Darkness Fall (December 1939 Unknown; exp 1941; rev 1949), in which an involuntary time-traveller to sixth-century Rome attempts to prevent the onset of the Dark Ages; this was the most accomplished early excursion into History in magazine sf, and is regarded as a classic. Other contributions to Unknown included &quot;None but Lucifer&quot; (September 1939 Unknown) with H L Gold; Solomon&#039;s Stone (June 1942 Unknown; 1956); the long title story of Divide and Rule (coll 1948); the title story alone being republished as Divide and Rule (April-May 1939 Unknown as &quot;Divide and Rule!&quot;; 1990 chap dos); &quot;The Wheels of If&quot; (October 1940 Unknown) in The Wheels of If, And Other Science-Fiction (coll 1948), a Parallel-Worlds story, also cited below in reissued form; and The Undesired Princess (coll 1951), the title story &quot;The Undesired Princess&quot; (February 1942 Unknown) alone being republished in The Undesired Princess and The Enchanted Bunny (anth 1990), the second story being by David A Drake.\nDe Camp was, unusually, an author who seemed equally comfortable solo and in collaboration. Over and above the huge influence of his wife, he was most successful in his collaborations with Fletcher Pratt, whom he met in 1939. Pratt conceived the idea behind their highly successful Incomplete Enchanter series of humorous fantasies in which the protagonist, Harold Shea, is transported into a series of Parallel Worlds based on various myths and legends (> Science and Sorcery). As usual with de Camp, the publication sequence is complex. The main titles - all credited to both authors - are: The Incomplete Enchanter (May, August 1940 Unknown as &quot;The Roaring Trumpet&quot; and &quot;The Mathematics of Magic&quot;; coll of linked stories 1941; vt The Incompleat Enchanter 1979), The Castle of Iron (April 1941 Unknown; exp 1950) and Wall of Serpents (June 1953 Fantasy Fiction, 1954 Beyond #9 as &quot;The Wall of Serpents&quot; and &quot;The Green Magician&quot;; coll of linked stories 1960; vt The Enchanter Compleated 1980). After separate publication, the first two titles were initially assembled as The Compleat Enchanter: The Magical Misadventures of Harold Shea (omni 1975), and all three were eventually put together as The Intrepid Enchanter (omni 1988) - for the complex sequence of variant titles, all very similar, see Checklist. Without the involvement of Pratt, who died in 1956, Sir Harold and the Gnome King (1990 World Fantasy Convention Program Book; 1991 chap) and The Exotic Enchanter (coll 1995) with Christopher Stasheff were subsequently added to the Enchanter canon, de Camp&#039;s contribution to the latter being a novelette, &quot;Sir Harold of Zodanga&quot;; these late solo works, plus all the stories with Pratt, were assembled in the mistitled The Mathematics of Magic: The Enchanter Stories of de Camp and Pratt (coll 2007). Other collaborations with Pratt were The Land of Unreason (October 1941 Unknown; 1942) and The Carnelian Cube: A Humorous Fantasy (1948), the latter being published several years after it was written. In 1950, de Camp and Pratt (whom see for details) began their Gavagan&#039;s Bar series of Club Stories, assembled in Tales From Gavagan&#039;s Bar (coll 1953; exp 1978).\nAfter joining the US Naval Reserve in 1942, de Camp spent the war working in the Philadelphia Naval Yard alongside Isaac Asimov and Robert A Heinlein. Afterwards he published a few articles, but hardly any new fiction until &quot;The Animal-Cracker Plot&quot; (July 1949 Astounding) introduced his Viagens Interplanetarias stories, a loosely linked series set in a future where Brazil has become the dominant world power, the stories themselves being sited mainly on three worlds which circle the star Tau Ceti and are named after the Hindu gods Vishnu, Ganesha and Krishna; the planet Krishna was a romantically barbarian world on which de Camp could set, as sf, the kind of Planetary Romances he had previously written as fantasy, the market for pure fantasy having disappeared with Unknown in 1943. Other planets circling other stars included Osiris, Isis and Thoth. Many of the short stories in the series were included in The Continent Makers and Other Tales of the Viagens (coll 1953); others appeared in Sprague de Camp&#039;s New Anthology of Science Fiction (coll 1953); &quot;The Virgin of Zesh&quot; (February 1953 Thrilling Wonder) was assembled together with the unconnected The Wheels of If (October 1940 Unknown; 1990 chap dos) (see separate citing above) in The Virgin and the Wheels (coll 1976). Rogue Queen (1951), a novel in the series, depicts a matriarchal humanoid society based on a hive structure; it is, with Lest Darkness Fall, de Camp&#039;s most highly regarded sf work. The remaining novels, an internal series all set on Krishna, were Cosmic Manhunt (August-September 1949 Astounding as &quot;The Queen of Zamba&quot;; 1954 dos; vt A Planet Called Krishna 1966; with restored text and with &quot;Perpetual Motion&quot; [September/October Future Science Fiction as &quot;Wide-Open Planet&quot;] added, rev vt as coll The Queen of Zamba 1977); The Search for Zei (October-November 1950 Astounding as the first half of &quot;The Hand of Zei&quot;; 1962; vt The Floating Continent: The Second Volume in the Famous Krishna Series 1966) and The Hand of Zei (December 1950-January 1951 Astounding as the second half of &quot;The Hand of Zei&quot;; 1963; cut 1963), both titles finally being superseded by publication of the full original novel, The Hand of Zei (October 1950-January 1951 Astounding; 1982); The Tower of Zanid (May-August 1958 Science Fiction Stories; cut 1958; with &quot;The Virgin of Zesh&quot; added, vt as coll The Virgin of Zesh/The Tower of Zanid 1983); The Hostage of Zir (1977); The Bones of Zora (1983) with Catherine Crook de Camp; and The Swords of Zinjaban (1991) with Catherine Crook de Camp. They contain a blend of intelligent, exotic adventure and wry humour characteristic of de Camp&#039;s better work, though they do not explore any too deeply either the romantic or the human-condition ironies available to aspiring authors of the Planetary Romance.\nDe Camp was in any case not to write much more sf, his later career increasingly being devoted to outright fantasy and to Sword and Sorcery. He had gained an interest in the latter category through reading Robert E Howard&#039;s Conan stories, and worked extensively on editing and adding to that series. Tales of Conan (coll 1955; vt Conan: The Flame Knife 1981) consists of unfinished Howard manuscripts converted into Conan stories and completed by de Camp (for remaining titles, see listing below). His nonfiction writings on the sword-and-sorcery genre have been published as The Conan Reader (coll 1968), Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers (1976) and Blond Barbarians and Noble Savages (1975 chap). He also edited several theme anthologies, beginning with Swords and Sorcery (anth 1963), and co-edited the critical anthologies The Conan Swordbook (anth 1969) and The Conan Grimoire (anth 1972), both with George H Scithers. De Camp&#039;s own first sword-and-sorcery effort was the Pusadian sequence of tales assembled as The Tritonian Ring and Other Pusadian Tales (coll 1953); the title novel was later published alone as The Tritonian Ring (Winter 1951 Two Complete Science-Adventure Books; 1968). Later he wrote several stories set in the imaginary world of Novaria: The Goblin Tower (1968), which is his most substantial novel of this type, The Clocks of Iraz (1971), The Fallible Fiend (December 1972-February 1973 Fantastic: 1973), The Unbeheaded King (1983) and The Honorable Barbarian (1989) - the first, second and fourth of these five being assembled as The Reluctant King (omni 1984).\nDe Camp&#039;s most notable sf writings after about 1950 were stories like The Glory that Was (April 1952 Startling; 1960) and &quot;A Gun for Dinosaur&quot; (March 1956 Galaxy), the Dinosaur title story of A Gun for Dinosaur, And Other Imaginative Tales (coll 1963), which also included &quot;Aristotle and the Gun&quot; (February 1958 Astounding). The first and third of these tales use history themes, in the case of the third combined with Time Travel, in a manner similar to Lest Darkness Fall; the second is a straightforward time-travel story. De Camp produced one of the earliest books about modern sf, Science Fiction Handbook (1953; rev 1975) with Catherine Crook de Camp; a useful compendium of information and advice for aspiring writers in its original edition, it gained little from its subsequent revision - indeed, the revised version omitted some material of interest. Otherwise he wrote historical novels and nonfiction works, including a book on Magic with his wife: Spirits, Stars and Spells: The Profits and Perils of Magic (1966). His opinions about the nature of Fantasy and the appropriate decorum necessary to write within the genre were expressed in an energetic, if sometimes reactionary, fashion in his many articles. He also wrote definitive lives of H P Lovecraft - Lovecraft: A Biography (1975; cut 1976) - and of Robert E Howard - Dark Valley Destiny: The Life of Robert E. Howard (1983) with Catherine Crook de Camp and Jane Whittington Griffin (?   -1983), the latter book having been preceded by The Miscast Barbarian: A Biography of Robert E Howard (1906-1936) (1975 chap). In the 1980s, and into his own ninth decade, more and more often in explicit collaboration with his wife, he maintained a remarkable reputation for consistency of output. He was given the Gandalf (Grand Master) Award for 1976, the SFWA Grand Master Award for 1978, the World Fantasy Award for lifetime achievement in 1984, and the Pilgrim Award in 1998. His autobiography, Time & Chance: An Autobiography (1996), which won a Hugo, reflects little in the way of shadows, though it is occasionally stiff-tongued; his last work seemed as agelessly smiling as the first Harold Shea tales 60 years earlier.

By internal chronology they are: The Legends of Camber of Culdi, comprising Camber of Culdi (1976), Saint Camber (1978) and Camber the Heretic (1980); The Heirs of Saint Camber, comprising The Harrowing of Gwynedd (1989), King Javan&#039;s Year (1992) and The Bastard Prince (1994); The Chronicles of the Deryni comprising Deryni Rising (1970), Deryni Checkmate (1972) and High Deryni (1973) - all assembled as The Chronicles of the Deryni (omni 1985) - King Javan&#039;s Year (1992) and The Bastard Prince (1994); and The Histories of King Kelson, comprising The Bishop&#039;s Heir (1984), The King&#039;s Justice (1985), The Quest for Saint Camber (1986) and King Kelson&#039;s Bride (2000). These chronicles tell the history of a group of humans whose witchlike Psi Powers, the explanation for which hovers between sf and mysticism, cause them to be persecuted by a medieval Church. The first-written novel Deryni Rising is perhaps the best, but the whole is generally much above average for Heroic Fantasy and is well characterized, although sometimes archaic and modern language clash.

From elementary school onward I was encouraged by my teachers to pursue art.\nAs a fine arts major in college I was discouraged from illustration as a career, &quot;illustration&quot; being a disparaging term in that academic environment. Nevertheless I was fascinated by the idea of suggesting stories through images, much in the same way program music may suggest a series of events. My ongoing love of science, music, fantasy, and genre fiction provided a melding of images with subject matter so that illustration became the natural outlet for my creativity.\nBy 1980 I had worked my way into the science fiction subculture. Well, actually I was pushed into it, and what a surprise it was! My first exhibit was a near sell out and provided the contacts for my first published work in Future Life Magazine. I have since provided many illustrations for publications in the US and in Europe. I have illustrated the covers of books by such authors as Anne McCaffrey, Piers Anthony, Norman Spinrad, and others. My clients have included the Doubleday Publishing Group, Grolier Science Encyclopedia, Funk and Wagnalls, TSR, Inc., and NASA, among others.\nStill residing in Nashville, I currently am involved in working with other artists collaboratively and I find this creatively stimulating.

      "bio": "Terry Brooks was born in Illinois in 1944, where he spent a great deal of his childhood and early adulthood dreaming up stories in and around Sinnissippi Park, the very same park that would eventually become the setting for his bestselling Word & Void trilogy. He went to college and received his undergraduate degree from Hamilton College, where he majored in English Literature, and he received his graduate degree from the School of Law at Washington & Lee University. \nA writer since high school, he wrote many stories within the genres of science fiction, western, fiction, and non-fiction, until one semester early in his college years he was given The Lord of the Rings to read. That moment changed Terry&#039;s life forever, because in Tolkien&#039;s great work he found all the elements needed to fully explore his writing combined in one genre. \nHe then wrote The Sword of Shannara, the seven year grand result retaining sanity while studying at Washington & Lee University and practicing law. It became the first work of fiction ever to appear on the New York Times trade paperback bestseller list, where it remained for over five months. \nDuring the spare time he could afford from his law practice, Terry wrote The Elfstones of Shannara, which followed in 1982 and once again brought the literary world an epic novel of wonder and adventure in the eagerly awaited sequel to The Sword of Shannara. The Wishsong of Shannara, published in 1985, finished the remarkable trilogy. \nAfter publishing his first three Shannara novels, Terry knew that writing was not only his life&#039;s ambition but that he could make a living with it as well. Even though he was hesitant, he quit his practice of law to pursue a full-time writing career. He moved to Seattle and began writing Magic Kingdom for Sale--Sold!, which began a bestselling new series for him in 1986. After two more Landover novels-The Black Unicorn and Wizard At Large-Terry wrote The Heritage of Shannara, a four-book series returning to the very heart that had made him such a success. The publication of The Talismans of Shannara in 1993 concluded that storyline. \nTerry can&#039;t write in one series for long. He needs, as a creative writer, to take time off from a project which inevitably allows him to explore new mythos and ideas that he is constantly thinking about; he recharges himself in this way for when he comes back to a series it is meaningful storytelling. Rather than start a new Shannara novel after he finished The Heritage of Shannara series, he wrote two more Landover books-The Tangle Box & Witches&#039; Brew. \nOnce done with the Landover books and another foray into the Shannara series with the release of First King of Shannara, Terry decided to create something new. Since the beginning of The Heritage of Shannara series in 1990, Terry had been thinking of a new series; a dark, contemporary fantasy set in a town similar to the Illinois hometown he grew up in. The ideas for this new series grew, expanded, and grew some more over the next several years while he wrote other novels, and in September 1997 Terry released Running With the Demon, his darkest most complex masterwork yet. The story of Nest Freemark and John Ross continued in A Knight of the Word and Angel Fire East in what has been tentatively titled The Word & Void trilogy. \nIn the midst of writing The Word & Void trilogy, George Lucas, the esteemed creator of Star Wars, personally asked Terry if he would write the novelization to Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. Being a Star Wars fan Terry agreed easily and soon found himself travelling to Skywalker Ranch to discuss the project with Lucas, and a month before the theatrical release of the movie the book was published with great success. \nIt was during this time that Terry decided to have an official website, one that a dedicated fan would devote time towards to ensure that the latest news, touring information, and book summaries could be available to his fans. Terry found his fan. \nDuring the six years that followed the website&#039;s inception, Terry wrote two Shannara trilogies: The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara and High Druid of Shannara. The six books take place 130 years and 150 years respectively after the events of The Talismans of Shannara where Walker Boh is still a Druid and is still trying to form a new Druid Council.\nThe recent release of The Gypsy Morph, Book Three of the Genesis of Shannara series, finishes off a storyarc begun in Armageddon&#039;s Children and The Elves of Cintra. Terry has just finished releasing a new Landover novel as well! \nTerry Brooks lives with his wife Judine in the Pacific Northwest and on the road meeting his fans. \nTo read a more comprehensive biography of Terry Brooks, read his memoir/writing book titled Sometimes the Magic Works.\n(From <a href=&#039;http://www.bookbrowse.com/biographies/index.cfm/author_number/508/terry-brooks&#039;>Mr. Brooks&#039;s page</A> at the BookBrowse)",

There followed a variety of work, all adventure fiction - whose style is perhaps best described as brisk - in sf or fantasy settings, including the juvenile Space-Opera sequence comprising Space Angel (1979), in which the commandeering of a spaceship by an ancient Alien leads to adventures for a boy, and its sequel Spacer: Window of the Mind (1988). King of the Wood (1983) is set in an alternate USA inhabited variously by Norsemen, Native Americans, Aztecs and Spanish Muslims. The Cingulum sequence about a raffish spaceship crew&#039;s adventures is The Cingulum (1985), Cloak of Illusion (1985) and Cingulum #3: The Sword, the Jewel and the Mirror (1988). Roberts also collaborated on four books with Eric Kotani (whom see for details): the sequence Act of God (1985), The Island Worlds (1987) and Between the Stars (1988), as well as Delta Pavonis (1990). Roberts&#039;s The Enigma Variations (1989) sets an Amnesiac in a corporate future. While all this sf activity was going on, Roberts also contributed several titles to the ever-growing Conan series, set in a Shared World derived from Robert E Howard&#039;s famous Sword-and-Sorcery stories: Conan the Valorous * (1985), Conan the Champion * (1987), Conan the Marauder * (1988), Conan the Bold * (1989), Conan the Rogue * (1991), Conan and the Manhunters * (1994) and Conan and the Treasure of Python * (1994). The Stormlands series, set in a tribalized fantasy world, so far comprises The Islander (1990), The Black Shields (1991), The Poisoned Lands (1992), The Steel Kings (1993) and Queens of Land and Sea (1994). [PN]\nOther works: the associational SPQR sequence comprising SPQR (1990), SPQR II: The Catiline Conspiracy (1991), #3: The Sacrilege (1992) and #4: The Temple of the Muses (1992), police-procedural mystery novels set in ancient Rome.\n(Taken from <a href=&#039;http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/roberts_john_maddox&#039;>Mr. Roberts&#039; page</A> at the Encyclopedia of Science Fiction)\n",

I&#039;ve drawn, painted, and sculpted to create illustration, design (of several flavors) and fine art.\nI was born a service brat in Oakland, California . For the next eleven years my family moved up and down the West Coast, finally ending up on the Kenai Peninsula in south-central Alaska. Living in rural Alaska meant my role models were veterans from the big dubbya-dubbya two working in manly-man occupations. I anticipated following the same sort of career path and as a young man I did so, working in construction, oil production and serving as an officer in the Army for four years.Despite that background (or maybe because of it) I managed to end up in the creative industry doing work that I love. No matter how tough life gets, whether it be failing health or bleak business prospects I am thankful that I can make a living doing something that does not require me to sit in the mud, get shot at or work barehanded with pipe fittings in sub-zero weather.\n(From <a href=&quot;http://www.davidr3deitrick.com/pages/biography.html&quot;>David Dietrick&#39;s Official Page</a>)",

      "name": "Lois McMaster Bujold",
      "bio": "US writer who began publishing sf with &quot;Barter&quot; for Rod Serling&#039;s The Twilight Zone Magazine, March/April 1985. Almost all her published sf work is part of a loose series of often humorous adventures set in a future of feuding galactic colonies connected by Faster-than-Light &quot;Wormhole jumps&quot;. Most of these stories feature members of the Vorkosigan family, part of an elite military caste from the planet Barrayar, recently rediscovered by galactic civilization after regressing into semifeudalism. Shards of Honor (1986) and its immediate sequel Barrayar (1991) which won a 1992 Hugo, deal with the romance between Lord Aral Vorkosigan and a sophisticated off-worlder; the child of their marriage is Miles Vorkosigan, born with severe physical handicaps due to a politically inspired attempt to Poison his father. Miles grows up to become a supremely charismatic, witty, compulsively driven military genius who triumphantly transcends the difficulties caused by his brittle bones and 4ft 9in (1.45m) stature. His complicated double life in the Barrayaran Navy (as an ensign, soon transferred to Imperial Security) and the Dendarii Mercenaries (of which he accidentally becomes the founder and admiral) is followed, in order of internal chronology, in The Warrior&#039;s Apprentice (1986) - assembled with Shards of Honor as Test of Honor (omni 1987) - The Vor Game (first part February 1990 Analog as &quot;Weatherman&quot;; exp 1990), which won a 1991 Hugo; Cetaganda (October-December 1995 Analog; 1996), set in an interstellar empire controlled by a hierarchy of artificially created human subspecies; Brothers in Arms (1989) and the ambitious Mirror Dance (1994) (> Identity), recipient of a 1995 Hugo. The short stories in Borders of Infinity (fixup 1989) - assembled with The Vor Game as Vorkosigan&#039;s Game (omni 1990) - including the Hugo- and Nebula-winning &quot;The Mountains of Mourning&quot; (May 1989 Analog), feature Miles at various points in his early career. Ethan of Athos (1986), set after The Vor Game, focuses on Elli Quinn, who eventually becomes Miles&#039;s lover, and a representative of a male separatist culture threatened by the imminent failure of the technology which creates its children.\nIn Memory (1996), perhaps Bujold&#039;s most impressive novel, Miles is forced to confront the contradictions of his multiple identities and tangled loyalties, in the end choosing a vision of himself as an enlightened Barrayaran aristocrat over his life as a galactic mercenary. Chronologically subsequent volumes in the series present Miles as an older, more political and somewhat saner individual; to date these works comprise Komarr (1998), A Civil Campaign (1999) and Diplomatic Immunity (2003). Falling Free (December 1987-February 1988 Analog; 1988), Bujold&#039;s best known single novel and winner of the 1988 Nebula, is set 200 years before Shards of Honor and tells the story of a rebellion - by humans modified by Genetic Engineering to live in zero Gravity as &quot;quaddies&quot;, with extra arms in place of legs - against the company which has created them and plans, once their commercial value has expired, to dump them on a planetary surface; their descendants feature in the later series, in particular Diplomatic Immunity. Throughout the Miles Vorkosigan stories Bujold displays a considerable range, from the adventure fiction of The Warrior&#039;s Apprentice to the romantic comedy of manners of A Civil Campaign; from the murder mystery of &quot;The Mountains of Mourning&quot; to the questions of personal identity raised by Mirror Dance and Memory. Considered as a whole, the sequence achieves a notable density of internal reference, forming what is almost a single narrative - a march to the music of time resembling that of Poul Anderson&#039;s Dominic Flandry, but one explored in rather greater psychological depth.\nBujold&#039;s only other works which could be treated as sf are those in the Sharing Knife sequence, consisting of Beguilement (2006), Legacy (2007), Passage (2008) and Horizon (2009). These books, which concentrate on the relationship between one of Bujold&#039;s characteristically damaged male protagonists and the woman who rekindles his interest in life, are essentially romances, set in a Pastoral Post-Holocaust world in which a few individuals possess limited extranormal Psi Powers. The Chalion sequence (for which see below), of which Paladin of Souls (2003) won both a Hugo and a Nebula in 2004, is Fantasy, as is the unrelated novel The Spirit Ring (1992). Arguably, however, these works display a more traditionally science-fictional concern with logical extrapolation than much of her sf; certainly the theological background (> Religion) of the Chalion novels shows a taste for rigorous invention. Bujold is a writer whose books are both funny and humane. Her characters have strong feelings for each other and, when compared to similar military figures in the work of such male writers as Jerry Pournelle, are often remarkably (and perhaps unrealistically) gentle. Though the ideas content in her work is generally low, her novels and stories succeed on their own terms; she has developed into a skilled entertainer with a considerable following.

      "bio": "Lubov was born in St. Petersburg, Russia. Anxious for cultural and political freedom, Lubov immigrated to the United States. This move caused her to adapt to a culture very different than the one she had known. Although she has very few good memories of her youth while in Russia and of her move to the US, her early adversities forged a great strength of character that would benefit her for the rest of her life. It is this strength of character and her tenacious hold on truth that abounds in her art.\nPerhaps oddly, it is the art of the fantastic - fantasy, phantasmagoric - that draws Lubov&#039;s imagination and her skills as an artist. Her work has its own voice. It stands outside the cacophony of commercial art, the core purpose of which always will be to sell you something you don&#039;t necessarily need. Lubov studied art at the Chicago Art Institute, one of the most prestigious schools in the country, but she maintains that her true knowledge of art - her sense and sensibility - comes via her own studies. Lubov&#039;s work is singular in both imagination and execution. There is technical mastery in her work; mastery in the sense of the old masters. Lubov&#039;s art is a return to the pre-Raphaelites&#039; storied imagination, a thesis of art that resonates for Lubov. (Lubov&#039;s artistic inspirations include Adolphe-William Bouguerau, John W. Waterhouse, Maxfield Parrish, Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, Victor Mikailovich Vasnetsov, Arkhip Kuinji, Alphonse Mucha, and Rembrandt.) Lubov paints with oils, the most difficult painting medium of all. The technique itself is six hundred years old and nothing since devised can match the sheer power of this very human mode of expression when handled by such an expert.\nArt never was about mere self-expression; it is all about emotion. Art is the expression of the universal self; the human experience to which each person can relate. Of course, there exist many levels to art - its context, sub-text, and hidden text, or message - but if art requires explanation then it has failed. Lubov shows us, the appreciators of her art, understanding and appreciation by using the story of her painting and the wizardry of her technique. There exists in her work that indefinable something that conveys simultaneously both perfect innocence and vast wisdom. These rather contradictory qualities are found in the artist herself. Lubov is young and old; wise beyond her years.\nTo view her work in the proper manner, it might be simplest to think of her as a classical painter exploring the human condition through the scrim of the fantastic. Though still young, Lubov has the certain potential to become a master in the classic sense. It is your opportunity to enjoy, appreciate, and even collect Lubov&#039;s work now, before the world&#039;s great museums recognize her magnificent talent.\n(From <a href=&#039;http://www.lubov.net/bio.html&#039;>Lubov&#039;s Official Page</A>)",

But the truth is my first published work was an illustration. The picture was called &quot;Mother Giraffe and Children,&quot; and it appeared in the local newspaper when I was five years-old. I was paid two dollars, took my family out for ice cream on my earnings, and never returned to art again. Refining page after page of tall quadripeds, even if they were tall, stick quadripeds, was simply too labor intensive for my taste. So I turned to something easy: writing.\nI&#039;ve learned some things since I was five. One is that I still have a fondness for giraffes, even though I don&#039;t want to draw them, and another thing I&#039;ve learned is writing is far from easy. This latter bit of knowledge came after years of writing stories I thought would stop any and all presses, followed almost immediately by the painful realization that no print machinery ever turned silent on my behalf. Eventually I modified my expectations and worked toward learning how to write; writing what I felt compelled to write at that time; and occasionally publishing something.\nLike many people, I started writing short stories then mustered up my will and perseverance to try novels. Along the way I was fortunate to write a few articles, gift books, and to work as an editor of anthologies as well.\n(From <a href=&#039;http://www.wendywebb.org/biography/&#039;>Ms. Webb&#039;s Official Page</A>)",

      "bio": "US composer and writer, more active in and better known for her occult and mystery tales than for her early sf, which is mostly restricted to work from the 1970s; she has also written as Quinn Fawcett (with Bill Fawcett), Camille Gabor, Trystam Kith and Vanessa Pryor. After around 1980 she became (and has remained) identified with the Saint-Germain sequence of fantasies about a sympathetic immortal Vampire of aristocratic birth. Set in Europe and elsewhere over a span of centuries, the main sequence begins with Hotel Transylvania: A Novel of Forbidden Love (1978) and ends twenty-five volumes later (see Checklist) with An Embarrassment of Riches (2011); further volumes are expected. There are two subsidiary sequence, the Atta Olivia Clemens books about Saint-Germain&#039;s vampire lover beginning with A Flame in Byzantium (1987); and the Madelaine de Montalia books beginning with Out of the House of Life (1990). As these interlinked sequences have progressed, Yarbro has decreasingly concentrated upon the vampirism of her protagonists and spent much more energy establishing some historical verisimilitude for the territories visited, sticking more and more frequently to the end of the Roman Empire, where she has also set some nonfantastic historical novels. Other non-sf series include the Ogilvie, Tallant & Moon detective sequence with fantasy elements, beginning with Ogilvie, Tallant & Moon (1976; vt Bad Medicine 1990 as C Q Yarbro); and the Mycroft Holmes pastiches (> Sherlock Holmes; Steampunk) beginning with Against the Brotherhood: A Mycroft Holmes Novel (1997) with Bill Fawcett, writing together as Quinn Fawcett.\nIn other words, Yarbro soon moved a significant distance from sf - which she began publishing with &quot;The Posture of Prophecy&quot; for If in 1969 - and seems unlikely to return except casually, with the exception of a tale like Taji&#039;s Syndrome (1988), a Near Future medical thriller. Her most significant sf work, most of it decidedly more pessimistic about the world than her tales set in the past, include the tales assembled in Cautionary Tales (coll 1978), which share an energetic starkness, a tendency for her characters - as James Tiptree Jr remarked in her introduction to the book - to engage in rather arousing operatic duets and tirades, and a genuinely Dystopian vision of times to come; other tales of interest, though with decreasing sf content, were assembled in Signs & Portents (coll 1984) and Apprehensions and Other Delusions (coll 2004). Her first sf novel, Time of the Fourth Horseman (1976) - in which a plan to head off Overpopulation by reinfecting children with various diseases gets radically out of hand - confirmed this sense of the darkness of her work; as did False Dawn (in Strange Bedfellows, anth 1973, ed Thomas N Scortia; exp 1978), which is set further into the future and likewise deals with a world ravaged by mutated diseases. Nor did Hyacinths (1983), set in a Near-Future Dystopian America characterized by a wrecked economy and mind control, modify the sense that Yarbro was an author entirely in control of what she wished to say, and in what genre. Sf has been a genre which enabled her to look forward into the dark, on occasion. For the most part, she has gazed away from the darknesses she perceived in the times to come. She was honoured as a World Horror Grandmaster in 2003.

After high school, he attended the Colorado Institute of Art , Colorado State University and later transferred to Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California. After school, he worked at Walt Disney Studios, ultimately becoming head of the matte department. He worked on &quot;The Black Hole&quot;, &quot;Tron&quot;, &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, Stephen King&#039;s &quot;The Stand&quot; and most recently &quot;I, Robot&quot; for Weta Digital in New Zealand.\nWhile at Disney Studios, David began doing freelance art. His first published piece was the album cover for &quot;The Commodores Greatest Hits&quot;. His first sale of art for a book cover was for &quot;A Wizard in Bedlam,&quot; by Christopher Stasheff, published by DAW Books. In 1983 he moved to New York City, and a year later across the Hudson River to Hoboken, New Jersey.\nDavid has produced over 500 covers for most major publishers of science fiction and fantasy, including Baen, Bantam, DAW, Del Rey, Dell, Marvel, Omni, Playboy, Signet, and Tor. For Scholastic Inc, David painted 54 covers for K.A. Applegate&#039;s &quot;Animorphs&quot; series, along with the last 5 covers for the &quot;Everworld&quot; series.. He illustrated the popular &quot;Honor Harrington&quot; series for author David Weber.

My rampant imagination was a wild horse and I was super-glued to its back, with no choice but to go where ever it wanted to take me.\nLater, as I grew, I developed some self-discipline and learned to focus and concentrate on the tasks at hand.\nDuring high school I attended a vocational school that was being offered, after having enthusiastically quit the typing and home-ec classes that my parents rather loudly insisted that I take, since I had neither desire nor aptitude to be clerical or domestic.  At this school I studied photography, black and white darkroom work, and advertising layout and composition.\nResearch have always been among my greater passions.  History, mythology and folklore of various cultures have all now become inextricably and fully integrated parts of my personal &#039;data base&#039;.  The fantastic and the surreal hold strong sway over nearly everything I do, whether it&#039;s prose, fine art, or mask and costume design.\nSo by now my imagination is a powerful muscle that I exercise and wield at my will.

I didn&#039;t know any mask makers, and at the time  I couldn&#039;t find any books on the subject, so my only recourse was to just buy some leather and start experimenting with it.\nI gradually discovered what would and would not work and proceeded from there, only to learn many years later that what I was doing was exactly what the mask makers in Italy had been doing for centuries.\nSometimes the old ways are the best, even if you don&#039;t know they&#039;re the old ways.\n(From <a href=&#039;http://www.angel-mask.com/allabout.htm&#039;>Ms. Mandus&#039; Official page</A>)",

He started writing poetry and short fiction in the fifth grade, and a lifetime of reading, writing, and studying has given him a love of storytelling that clearly shows in his work. In his stories, he creates a consistent and rationally explained technology and society. Even when dealing with fantasy themes, the magical powers are treated like another technology with supporting rational laws and principles. Many of his stories have military, and particularly naval, themes, and fit into the military science fiction genre. He challenges current gender roles in the military by assuming that a gender-neutral military service will exist in his futures. By frequently placing female leading characters in what have previously been seen as traditionally male roles, he has explored the challenges faced by women in the military and politics. His most popular and enduring character is Honor Harrington, whose story, together with the \"Honorverse\" she inhabits, has been developed through nineteen novels, six shared-universe anthologies, a three book young-adult series, and â€œHonorverse historicalâ€ Manticore Ascendant series, written with Timothy Zahn and Tom Pope. To date, David currently has seventy six book titles and twenty one separate series that he has written or co-written.

      "bio": "Stephen Hickman (born April 9, 1949) is an award-winning American artist, illustrator, sculptor and author. He is best known for his work in science fiction and fantasy with over 350 book and magazine covers to his credit. His efforts have brought an extra dimension to the stories of Robert A. Heinlein, H. P. Lovecraft, J. R. R. Tolkien,[1] Anne McCaffery, and Andre Norton. He may be best known for illustrating Larry Niven&#039;s Man-Kzin Wars novels and the evocative dragons he created for Steven Brust&#039;s Dragaeran series, which have often been imitated. His most widely circulated effort is a series of space fantasy postage stamps done for the United States Postal Service.\nHickman has mastered a variety of styles and is known for his versatility. However, his work is especially notable for two features. His use of the possibilities of oil color, in layers both transparent and translucent, is balanced to create subtle moods that can range for the contemplative to the unsettling. Frank Kelly Freas said that no one since Rembrandt has mastered the use of gold the way Hickman has.\nAnother consistent feature of Hickman&#039;s work is the intelligence of his characters, especially the women. The faces of Hickman&#039;s subjects are fully engaged in thought, sometimes absorbed in a dream, sometimes on the verge of a climactic &quot;aha.&quot; This characteristic might best be compared to that of another Dutch painter, Vermeer.\nHickman says the most difficult thing to capture in art is the sublime, likening it to &#039;catching the gold ring on the artistic carousel&#039;. He strives to create a positive, reassuring effect in his viewers by communicating beauty and elegance. &quot;Besides, the elegant and sublime have a certain shock value in the present age.&quot; His style is classically based and often, as he puts it, with &quot;a strong vision quest aspect.&quot;\nStephen Hickman was born in Washington, DC, the son of John F. and Mary Lee Hickman. Because his father was in the foreign service, he was already a world traveler before high school, having lived in Manila and Karachi. He also lived in Texas and Arizona before his family returned to the Washington area, settling in Alexandria Virginia. Hickman&#039;s father regularly told him tales, from ghost stories to his own childhood experiences in the Philippine Islands, and Hickman credits him with inspired his interest in literature and writing. Hickman&#039;s mother introduced him to painting and encouraged him to be original in all things. Both parents were supportive of his creative endeavors.\nIn Alexandria, Hickman went to Francis Hammond High School. The art program was directed by Fletcher Proctor, who later was responsible for art in the whole school district. Between regular and summer sessions, Hickman had the equivalent of eight years of training in art from Proctor, what he considered to be all of useful training he had for his profession. After graduating high school, Hickman spent two years at Richmond Professional Institute (now part of Virginia Commonwealth University) where he shared classes with Mike Kaluta and Phil Trumbo.\nA turning point for Hickman&#039;s career was when he went to the 1967 NY Comic Convention. There he met Frank Frazetta and Roy G. Krenkel. He found that both men were thoughtful and helpful. He got advice that included mastering artistic anatomy, with special attention to the skeleton. They advised him to spend the money on decent brushes. The conventional was also eye-opening for him because he got to see original painting after years of only knowing the artists through paperback covers.\nHickman&#039;s professional career was launched in 1972 when he got a job creating T-shirt designs for Shirt Explosion in Lanham, MD. In this situation where Hickman was given virtually unlimited artistic freedom, he realized that he could earn a living by doing what he wanted to. His entry into book illustration came in 1974, when Neil Adams of Continuity Studios, NYC, introduced Hickman to Charles Volpe, Art Editor at Ace Books. Volpe bought the printing rights of items from his portfolio, and later commissioning paintings which were used for reprints of Ace Doubles in the Classics of Science-Fiction series. Since then he has been a full-time artist. Some of his work has been collected in The Fantasy Art of Stephen Hickman. He has been honored with a Hugo Award (1993, for Achievement in Science Fiction and Fantasy), five Chesley Awards and two gold awards from the Spectrum Anthology.\nHickman has tried his hand at writing and illustrating his own work. His novel, The Lemurian Stone, was published in 1988. In this work, he created the Pharazar Mythos, which has been the basis for several major paintings, including The Lion Pavilion and The Astronomer Prince. His work has also motivated other writers. Most notably, The Diver and Mermaid, done as a private commission, inspired Harlan Ellison to write &quot;Midnight in the Sunken Cathedral.&quot;\n(From <a href=&#039;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hickman&#039;>Mr. Hickman&#039;s page</A> at Wikipedia)",

      "bio": "US writer who began publishing sf with &quot;The Emerson Effect&quot; for Rod Serling&#39;s The Twilight Zone Magazine in December 1981, coming to prominence with &quot;Cryptic&quot; (April 1983 Asimov&#39;s), a tale whose theme - First Contact between humans and the Alien races who are sending messages across space - was elaborated in his first novel, The Hercules Text (1986), which won a Locus Award. Despite the occasional descent into cliche in his plotting and his politics (even as early as 1986 the vision of the USA coming close to war with the USSR over ownership of the information in the signals lacked extrapolative vigour), McDevitt manages in this tale to concentrate very effectively on the human dimensions of the conundrum posed by the existence of a Communication whose contents, when deciphered, might well devastate human civilization from the shock of this First Contact; and the Roman Catholic viewpoint of one of the Scientists involved in decoding the message is presented with an obvious sympathy which does not hamper the storytelling, which involves threats of violent skulduggery. The sequence which evolved from this tale - the Alex Benedict series, which also comprises A Talent for War (1989), assembled with a revised version of The Hercules Text as Hello, Out There (omni 2000); plus Polaris (2004), Seeker (2005), which won the Nebula award in 2006, and The Devil&#39;s Eye (2008) - moves into a galactic venue nine thousand years hence. In A Talent for War, which is similarly set within a religious frame, the young Alex Benedict must thread his way through the unsettled hinterlands dividing human and Alien space in his search for the secret that may retroactively destroy the reputation of a human who had been a hero in the recent wars. In later volumes, Benedict becomes a highly convincing representative of the noirish detective hero whose traversals of the archaeologies of Western America (or, in this case, of the inhabited galaxy aeons hence) lead not only to a solving of crimes or other mysteries but also, and more importantly, to a recuperation of lost worlds (&gt; Ruins and Futurity). This is perhaps most evident in Seeker, the best organized tale of the sequence, where Benedict&#39;s hunt for the long-hidden underlying causes of the disappearance millennia earlier of the lost colony of Margolia (&gt; Time Abyss) becomes a lesson in the impossibility of acquiring any comprehensive narrative of the past in the kind of expanded future we might imagine: for it is not only that the past becomes Mythology in many ambitious Space Opera universes, but that the past is inherently beyond our tools of understanding. Despite the easy old-boy style of the tale, the final lesson of Seeker is that the human species - there is no hint of the Singularity in McDevitt&#39;s moderately distant future - is not designed to comprehend itself or the universe it inhabits. McDevitt&#39;s second sequence - the Academy/Priscilla Hutchins series comprising The Engines of God (1994), Deepsix (2001), Chindi (2002), Omega (2003), Odyssey (2006) and Cauldron (2007) - is perhaps rather more easy on the reader during the movement of its narrative arc from Near Future near space into a galaxy full of solvable conundrums (Thought Experiment); the lead protagonist, Priscilla Hutchins, is in this case literally an archaeologist, and in the final volume of the sequence is privy to the solution of a number of problems left previously unresolved, rather damaging to the Sense of Wonder evoked by the taxing marvels described in the earlier instalments. Omega won a John W Campbell Memorial Award. The latest Academy novel, Starhawk, was released in 2013. Several individual novels are notable as well. Ancient Shores (1996) traces the Discovery of a buried ancient civilization, including relics of a highly advance Technology, imperishable metals (a familiar Icon from 1950s sf), and Matter Transmission via Stargates. Eternity Road (1997) is set in a genuinely beguiling Ruined Earth America, a millennia after the holocaust; duly, a Keep containing scientific secrets is found far up the Mississippi River, and lessons are learned about the deep past, though the new world continues. Moonfall (1998) is a complicated Disaster tale involving the destruction of the eponymous Moon. Infinity Beach (2000; vt Slow Lightning 2000) is a tale of Entropy: spread among the stars, the human race has clearly become as marginal to the long narratives of history as is the protagonist of the tale to most of its action; only when she becomes, as so often in McDevitt&#39;s work, a kind of detective spelunking the gnomic backstory of the race, does the book take fire. But it is clearly McDevitt&#39;s intention to cast doubt on the fire. He composes ostensibly positivist tales in clear for readers looking for release, as demonstrated in his light-fingered ease with Time Paradoxes in Time Travelers Never Die (2009); but the contemplative reticence underlying his work should never be ignored. He is perhaps the most adult of all writers of adventure sf.

      "name": "Ben Bova",
      "bio": "US writer and editor who worked as technical editor for Project Vanguard 1956-1958, and science writer for Avco Everett Research Laboratory 1960-1971, before being appointed editor of Analog following the death of John W Campbell Jr in 1971. The magazine had become creatively moribund - although it remained commercially healthy - during the last decade of so of Campbell&#039;s editorship. Bova maintained the magazine&#039;s orientation towards technophilic Hard SF but considerably broadened its horizons. In doing so he alienated some readers, who shared Campbell&#039;s puritanism - such stories as &quot;The Gold at the Starbow&#039;s End&quot; (March 1972 Analog) by Frederik Pohl and &quot;Hero&quot; (June 1972 Analog) by Joe W Haldeman, inoffensive though they might seem in the outside world, brought strong protests - but he revitalized the magazine, perhaps most notably with the 1972-1974 Haldeman sequence that began with &quot;Hero&quot; and became The Forever War (June 1972-January 1975 Analog; fixup 1974). In recognition of this, he received the Hugo for Best Editor every year 1973-1977; although he missed out in 1978 he gained it again in 1979 for his work during 1978, his final year as editor. Bova also involved the magazine&#039;s name in other activities, producing Analog Annual (anth 1976) - an original anthology intended as a thirteenth issue of the magazine - initiating a series of records and inaugurating a book-publishing programme. In 1978-1982 he was editor of Omni. From both journals he extracted several anthologies (see Checklist below). He served as president of the Science Fiction Writers of America 1990-1992.\nBova was active as a writer for many years before his stint at Analog, his first published sf being Young Adult novel, The Star Conquerors (1959), which began the Watchmen sequence also comprising Star Watchman (1964) and The Dueling Machine (May 1963 Analog with Myron R Lewis; exp 1969), the latter two assembled as Watchmen (omni 1994). He continued to concentrate on this market until THX 1138 * (1971), based on the George Lucas screenplay (> THX 1138). His next sequence, the Exiles series - Exiled from Earth (January-February 1971 Galaxy; 1971), Flight of Exiles (1972) and End of Exile (1975), all three being assembled as The Exiles Trilogy (omni 1980) - is also children&#039;s sf. Considerable work in shorter forms followed over the next decades, the best of it being assembled as Forward in Time (coll 1973), Viewpoint (coll 1977), Maxwell&#039;s Demons (coll 1979), Escape Plus (coll 1984), The Astral Mirror (coll 1985), partly nonfiction, Prometheans (coll 1986), Battle Station (coll 1987) and Twice Seven: Stories (coll 1998). Other early novels of interest include The Starcrossed (1975), a humorous example of Recursive SF whose protagonist is a thinly disguised Harlan Ellison (> The Starlost), The Multiple Man (1976), a suspense-thriller built on the concept of Clones, and Privateers (1985), which - along with its sequel, Empire Builders (1993) - succumbs to an assumption common to US hard sf: that governments will sooner or later fail to conquer space, and that individual entrepreneurs (vast multinational corporations exercising Japanese foresight [in the twenty-first century, Chinese foresight] need not apply) will take up the slack.\nBova&#039;s best-known stories, those about Chet Kinsman, an astronaut during the latter years of the twentieth century, were assimilated into the Kinsman Saga, whose internal ordering is Kinsman (fixup 1979) and Millennium (1976), the two volumes being assembled as The Kinsman Saga (omni 1987); Millennium, his best early novel (and perhaps his best altogether), is a tale of power-Politics in the face of impending nuclear Holocaust as the century ends. Colony (1978), set in a Lagrange-5 habitat in the same universe, carries the story - and humanity - further towards the stars, embodying the outward-looking stance Bova has held throughout his writing life, along with an ever-ready cynicism about government initiatives of any sort. More tellingly, the Voyagers sequence - Voyagers (1981), Voyagers II: The Alien Within (1982) and Voyagers III: Star Brothers (1990) - treats humanity&#039;s expansion within a framework of Space-Opera romance, with technology-dispensing Aliens establishing First Contact with emergent humans, star-crossed lovers, biochips and a great deal more. The Orion sequence - Orion (1984), Vengeance of Orion (1988), Orion in the Dying Time (1990), Orion and the Conqueror (1994) and Orion Among the Stars (May-August 1995 Analog; 1995) - puts into fantasy idiom a similar expansive message. Early novels and sequences like this, and the more recent Tales of the Grand Tour (see below), unfailingly advocate a private-enterprise based movement of humanity toward the stars; on this subject, Bova is consistently eloquent.\nThe more recent Triumph (1993), based on the somewhat precarious premise that Winston Churchill poisons Stalin in 1943 with a radioactive ceremonial sword, is an Alternate History tale which posits a more favourable outcome to World War Two. Technothrillers like Death Dream (1993) are stiff with earnest exposition of material not perhaps suitable for a thriller format or audience; Bova&#039;s most sustained and interesting work continues to focus on relatively Near Future scenarios of human frustration/expansion into space. The best instalments in the loosely-structured Tales of the Grand Tour (for books included in this retroactive rubric, see Checklist below) are those, like Mars (1992) (> Mars), which describe with lovingly detailed verisimilitude various crunch points in the crusade outward; in this case, he focuses on the first manned flight to that planet. The series novel Titan (2006) won a John W Campbell Memorial Award. Tales of the Grand Tour (coll 2004) offers a guide to the sequence, which is described by Bova with sufficient flexibility to be associated even with the Kinsman Saga, a series so outpaced by history that it reads as though set in an alternate universe (> Alternate History). The straightforwardness of Bova&#039;s agenda for humanity may mark him as a figure from an earlier era; but the arguments he laces into sometimes overloaded storylines are arguments it is important, perhaps absolutely vital, to make.

      "guest_id": "guest92",
      "name": "Harry Turtledove",
      "bio": "US writer and academic who has made use of his field of scholarship (his PhD was in Byzantine history) to create all his best-known work, including several associational historical novels as by H N Turteltaub. The fantasy Videssos Cycle - The Misplaced Legion (1987), An Emperor for the Legion (1987), The Legion of Videssos (1987) and Swords of the Legion (1987), with the Krispos sequence, Krispos Rising (1991), Krispos of Videssos (1991) and Krispos the Emperor (1994), serving as a prequel - follows the exploits of a Roman legion translated to the empire of Videssos, situated in a world where Magic works and Byzantine history is recapitulated. The Basil Argyros stories (1985-1987), set in an Alternate History in which Mahomet became a Christian saint - assembled as Agent of Byzantium (coll of linked stories 1987) - follows the exploits of a medieval secret agent who tends to cause scientific innovations against both his brief and his intentions. Though these books focus on their various charismatic and canny protagonists, Turtledove&#039;s thorough understanding of his source material gracefully infiltrates the fun and fantastication.\nHe began writing work of genre interest with two Sword-and-Sorcery tales as by Eric G Iverson, Wereblood (1978) and its sequel Werenight (1979), which initiate the Gerin the Fox sequence of fantasies ending with Fox and Empire (1998) for details see Checklist; and was soon publishing sf and fantasy with some frequency, sometimes as by Eric G Iverson, some of his better non-series work being assembled as Kaleidoscope (coll 1990). Noninterference (fixup 1988) - in which a galactic survey team runs across Aliens - and Earthgrip (fixup 1991) - in which a reader of sf uses the expertise so gained to save alien races - are, unusually for Turtledove, straight sf books not set in alternate worlds, and were assembled with Kaleidoscope as 3 X T (omni 2004). A Different Flesh (fixup 1988) places hominid survivors (> Apes as Human) in an alternate USA, and A World of Difference (fixup 1989) confronts Soviet and US missions on an alternate Mars - here called Minerva - populated by warring Minervans. Certainly his most important singleton, and perhaps his finest sustained narrative, is The Guns of the South: A Novel of the Civil War (1992), in which the South wins through the aid of Afrikaners who Time Travel with advanced Technologies which are used to defeat the North. After the publication of this dramatic and sustained tale, Turtledove came into his own as the most famous and most prolific authors of Alternate History sequences; though some of the later series come dangerously close to repeating the techniques and motifs of earlier work, two long-running multi-section multi-volume narratives do stand out. Both are remarkable for their ingenuity, and for their almost unremitting (and sometimes savagely melodramatic) focus on War.\nThe Worldwar sequence is perhaps the more appealing of the two, in that much of the internecine intensity of Turtledove&#039;s treatment of purely planetary issues is here partially escaped. The first series within the overall sequence - Worldwar: In the Balance (1994), Worldwar: Tilting the Balance (1995), Worldwar: Upsetting the Balance (1996) and Worldwar: Striking the Balance (1996) - features a World War Two very similar to our own, until the Invasion of an Alien fleet (> Colonization of Other Worlds; {IMPERIALISM IN SF}) changes everything. Before an ultimate stalemate can be painfully achieved, Germany becomes an ally of America (with consequences close to those encountered in many Hitler Wins tales), nuclear conflict devastates the planet, and the aliens come to occupy most of the world beyond the realm of the beleaguered allies, dominant among them being America, Germany and Russia. The second series - the Worldwar: Colonization tales comprising Colonization: Book One: Second Contact (1999), Colonization: Down to Earth (2000) and Aftershocks (2001) - takes place in the 1960s, with the two races occupying the planet vying constantly for supremacy, a conflict in which advances in Technology tend to turn the tables fairly often. Homo sapiens, in line with a deep-rooted American Genre SF assumption, is much quicker-witted and adaptive than the alien foe, who are comfortingly obtuse and very clearly described in accordance with the traditional view that invading alien armies would necessarily be commanded by hidebound, reptile-thick bureaucrats - though in this series individual aliens do show an alarming ability to take on human characteristics, including a passion for Baseball. In the midst of all this, a continuing human campaign to develop a slower-than-light Starship points readers to the final volume of the overall sequence, Homeward Bound (1999), in which human forces arrive on the alien planet, Home, a threat to the balance of power that almost leads to a mutually destructive final war, though the arrival of a second human force in a Faster Than Light ship tips that balance in our favour.\nThe second multi-volume sequence, whose surtitle is Southern Vision, is much darker than Worldwar, depicting at great length the century after 1860 as subject to almost constant War, with extended episodes being couched in Military SF terms. The Jonbar Point for this Alternate History comes when the Union does not discover General Lee&#039;s plans to invade Maryland (the historical Special Order 191 did fall into Union hands, and arguably turned the course of the American Civil War), and the Confederacy wins, maintaining a racist hegemony over much of America during the course of the following war-torn decades (> Race in SF), not finally losing to the USA until the 1920s. In the meanwhile, on the larger scene, World War One begins, though much of Turtledove&#039;s attention is focused on the increasingly savage final conflict between the North and the South, which is recounted in terms of the same futile trench-warfare stalemate that marked the European conflict for years. After 1920, Canada, now an American colony under harsh control, suffers through the Governor-Generalship of General Custer. World War Two then breaks out, with the resurgent Confederacy attacking the North; during this war, Germany and other nations develop nuclear power: bombs duly destroy St Petersburg, Paris, London, and many other world cities. The world Turtledove creates in Southern Vision is significantly bleaker than our own.\nLater sf series, as indicated above, tend to repetition, though it may be that fantasy analogues - such as the Darkness sequence, beginning with Into the Darkness (1999) and ending with Out of the Darkness (2004), where a version of World War Two is fought in a universe where Magic exists - may have moments of genuine freshness; this may also be the case with the War Between the Cronies sequence, beginning with Sentry Peak (2000) and ending with Advance and Retreat (2004), where the Civil War is also fought in a world with magic. The Crosstime Traffic sequence of Young Adult tales set in a variety of Parallel Worlds, beginning with Gunpowder Empire (2003) and ending with The Valley-Westside War (2008), homages H Beam Piper&#039;s Paratime books and parallels Charles Stross&#039;s Merchant Princes sequence, which began in 2004. The Lost Continent of Atlantis sequence, beginning with Opening Atlantis (2007) and perhaps concluding with Liberating Atlantis (2009), is initiating by a very large-scale Jonbar Point: the calving off of the eastern seaboard of America, millions of years ago, into a separate continent which is discovered in 1492. A late sequence, the War That Came Early series beginning with Hitler&#039;s War (2009), may not prove to add much to Turtledove&#039;s several previous versions of World War Two.\nTurtledove has never failed to be exuberant when he sees the chance; and although it may be argued that he has not yet written any single book that has unduly stretched his very considerable intelligence, it may at the same time be suggested that the overall impact of his longer sequences is indeed considerable. Beneath the virtuoso sadism of his descriptions of conflict, and his sometimes morally unstable sweet-tooth for the depiction of Realpolitik in action, lies a sadness that perhaps befits our times, and an intermittent sense that we are better off in this world, that we know to be true, than in any realistic alternatives we might try to imagine. Turtledove won a 1994 Best Novella Hugo Award for &quot;Down in the Bottomlands&quot; (January 1993 Analog).

      "bio": "US man-of-letters and author, professionally involved in the sf field as an editor, agent, fan and writer since his teens, his first published piece being a poem, &quot;Elegy to a Dead Satellite: Luna&quot; (October 1937 Amazing) as by Elton V Andrews, and his first story proper - the first of well over 200 in an active career of more than seven decades (> Longevity (in Writers and Publications)) - being &quot;Before the Universe&quot; with C M Kornbluth, both writing as S D Gottesman, for Super Science Stories, July 1940; this and other early work was assembled as one of his memorial collections of collaborations with his main writing partner: Before the Universe, and Other Stories (coll 1980) with C M Kornbluth. His third marriage was to sf writer Judith Merril (1949-1952) and his fourth to Carol Metcal Ulf Stanton (1952-1983), who collaborated with him (as Carol Pohl) in editing several anthologies, including the Science Fiction: The Great Years sequence (see Checklist). His fifth wife, Elizabeth Anne {HULL} (married 1984), is an academic and a leading member of the Science Fiction Research Association. Pohl was a member of the Futurians, and wrote much of his early work in collaboration with other members of the group, mostly with C M Kornbluth. Names used by these two, sometimes involving third parties - including Robert A W Lowndes and Joseph H Dockweiler (> Dirk Wylie) - were S D Gottesman (see above), Scott Mariner, Dirk Wylie and the House Name Paul Dennis Lavond. On his early solo work Pohl usually used the name James MacCreigh, though he published one story each as Wylie and Warren F Howard. He published much of this work himself while editing Astonishing Stories and Super Science Stories Spring 1940-Fall 1941; he was subsequently assistant editor to Alden Norton on these magazines from late 1941 until their demise in 1943.\nAfter intense military service in World War Two, Pohl became active as an sf literary agent, representing many of the most celebrated writers in the field during the late 1940s. Though his production of new work never fully ceased, he only began writing seriously again around 1950, after abandoning the MacCreigh pseudonym. While working as assistant editor to H L Gold at Galaxy Science Fiction he wrote a great deal for the magazine, usually under his own name, sometimes as Paul Flehr, Ernst Mason or Charles Satterfield, the last name used once for a story written in collaboration with Lester del Rey, in partnership with whom he also wrote Preferred Risk (June-September 1955 Galaxy; 1955) as Edson McCann. Other writers with whom he collaborated at one time or another were Merril, Isaac Asimov, Joseph Samachson, and Arthur C Clarke, the last on The Last Theorem (2008), a relatively weak completion of a work left unfinished by Clarke at his death. After Kornbluth, Pohl&#039;s main partnership was with Jack Williamson, a collaboration extending nearly four decades. Pohl was editor of Galaxy and If from late 1961 to mid-1969. While under his aegis If won three Hugos as Best Magazine 1966-1968. He also founded and edited two shorter-lived magazines, Worlds of Tomorrow (1963-1967) and International Science Fiction (1967-1968). Another significant editorial endeavour was an early series of original Anthologies, Star Science Fiction Stories, beginning with Star Science Fiction Stories (anth 1953) and ending with Star Science Fiction Stories #6 (anth 1959) (for details see Checklist). He also edited numerous reprint anthologies, some of them - like The Expert Dreamers (anth 1962), sf stories by Scientists - moderately innovative.\nAs a writer Pohl made his first reputation by way of the slickly ironic short stories he produced during the 1950s and 1960s, mostly Satires with a hint of black comedy. Works in this vein include the classics &quot;The Midas Plague&quot; (April 1954 Galaxy; incorporated into Midas World, fixup 1983), a fine example of the Comic Inferno, and The Tunnel Under the World (January 1955 Galaxy; 2010 ebook); almost all these stories of the 1950s are collected in Alternating Currents (coll 1956; with one story dropped and one added, rev 1966), The Case Against Tomorrow (coll 1957), Tomorrow Times Seven (coll 1959), The Man Who Ate the World (coll 1960), Turn Left at Thursday (coll 1961) and The Abominable Earthman (coll 1963). Oddly, the only short-fiction award Pohl won before his 1986 Hugo for &quot;Fermi and Frost&quot; (January 1985 Asimov&#039;s) (> Nuclear Winter) was a Hugo for an atypical &quot;posthumous collaboration&quot; with Kornbluth, &quot;The Meeting&quot; (November 1972 F&SF), which appeared in Critical Mass (coll 1977) with Kornbluth; some of their collaborations had already been assembled as The Wonder Effect (coll 1962), and further selections appeared as Before the Universe, and Other Stories (coll 1980) (see above) and Our Best: The Best of Frederik Pohl and C M Kornbluth (coll 1987).\nIt was in the 1950s also that he cemented his growing reputation with his first novel in collaboration with Kornbluth, the classic The Space Merchants (July-August 1952 Galaxy as &quot;Gravy Planet&quot;; 1953).The gaudy image of a future dominated by Advertising painted in this tale now seems remarkably prescient (> Media Landscape) - although Pohl&#039;s solo sequel, The Merchants&#039; War (1984), was unfortunately belated; both novels were assembled as Venus, Inc (omni 1985). The episodic Search the Sky (1954; rev 1985) with Kornbluth is an enjoyable early contribution to the &quot;absurd-society&quot; variety of sf. Gladiator-at-Law (June-August 1954 Galaxy; 1955; rev 1986) with Kornbluth is sillier, but makes some telling comments on housing projects (> Crime and Punishment). The more ambitious and surrealistically complicated Wolfbane (October-November 1957 Galaxy; 1959; rev 1986) with Kornbluth involves invading alien Robots, the kidnapping of the planet Earth, primitive societies engineered to provide human components for living Machines on the aliens&#039; own dirigible planet, and a revolt organized by these.\nPohl&#039;s early solo novels were less successful: Slave Ship (March-May 1956 Galaxy; 1957), Drunkard&#039;s Walk (June-August 1960 Galaxy; 1960), A Plague of Pythons (October-December 1962 Galaxy; 1965; rev vt Demon in the Skull 1984) and The Age of the Pussyfoot (October 1965-February 1966 Galaxy; 1969) lack the vitality of his collaborations with Kornbluth, though the last has an interesting Prediction of the multi-function, Computer-linked mobile phone. But his collaborations with Williamson were vigorous and competent. They include Undersea Children&#039;s SF sequence - Undersea Quest (1954), Undersea Fleet (1955) and Undersea City (1958) (> Under the Sea) - and the Starchild novels, assembled as The Starchild Trilogy (omni 1977): The Reefs of Space (July-November 1963 If; 1964) (> Continuous Creation), Starchild (January-March 1965 If; 1965) and Rogue Star (June-August 1968 If; 1969). The latter are intelligent Space Operas combining Williamson&#039;s flair for melodrama with Pohl&#039;s economy of style. As Pohl&#039;s solo work matured, so did his collaborative work with Williamson. The Saga of Cuckoo - Farthest Star (fixup 1975) and Wall Around a Star (1983), assembled as The Saga of Cuckoo (omni 1983) - is action-adventure fiction involving a vast artificial world. Land&#039;s End (1988) confronts the human survivors of a cosmic Disaster with a godlike Alien. The Singers of Time (1991) is an excellent fusion of traditional space opera with modern ideas in Physics.\nThere was a sharp improvement in Pohl&#039;s longer works once he was no longer editing full time. Two fine tales, Starburst (March 1972 Analog as &quot;The Gold at the Starbow&#039;s End&quot;; exp 1982) and &quot;The Merchants of Venus&quot; (July/August 1972 If), were important transitional works, the latter forming a prelude to the enterprising Heechee series - Gateway (November 1976-March 1977 Galaxy; 1977), Beyond the Blue Event Horizon (1980), Heechee Rendezvous (January-May 1984 Amazing; 1984), The Annals of the Heechee (1987), The Gateway Trip: Tales and Vignettes of the Heechee (coll of linked stories 1990) including &quot;The Merchants of Venus&quot; (see above), and The Boy Who Would Live Forever (fixup 2004) - which tracks humanity&#039;s exploration of the Galaxy using artefacts abandoned by the Aliens known as the Heechee, who have gone into hiding because of a threat posed to all living species by the enigmatic Assassins. The universe depicted is, in the end, not well designed for humans to comprehend (an inference whose modesty in the face of the inconceivably complex distinguishes the Heechee series from the work of most of Pohl&#039;s contemporaries). Gateways: Original New Stories Inspired by Frederik Pohl (anth 2010), edited by Elizabeth Ann Hull, assembles tales in honour of the sequence. Gateway - almost certainly his best novel - won the Hugo, the Nebula and the John W Campbell Memorial Award, following up the success of Man Plus (April-June 1976 F&SF; 1976), an effectively cynical novel about the adaptation of a man for life on Mars which had won a Nebula the year before (> Cyborgs; Pantropy). The rather less impressive sequel to Man Plus is Mars Plus (1994) with Thomas T Thomas.\nJEM: The Making of a Utopia (November-December 1978 Galaxy; 1979) is a similarly cynical and compelling account of the Colonization of an alien world - which somewhat resembles the eponymous planet in Medea&#039;s World (anth 1985) edited by Harlan Ellison - by competing human power blocs, but the more lightly satirical The Cool War (1981) is less successful. Syzygy (1982), a mundane novel about the failure of a much-touted Disaster to overwhelm California as a result of a rare alignment of planets, understandably suffers from a lack of melodrama - an absence made good in two later non-sf novels, the thriller Terror (1986) and the &quot;drama-documentary&quot; novel Chernobyl (1987). Pohl occasionally complained about the unwillingness of sf writers to be constructive in their dealings with Near-Future scenarios, and he made a sustained attempt to practise what he preached in The Years of the City (fixup 1984), a Future History of the City of New York which won the John W Campbell Memorial Award. The Coming of the Quantum Cats (January-April 1986 Analog; 1986) is an Alternate-History adventure story only lightly seasoned with satire, but a more considerable satirical edge is evident in Black Star Rising (1985), Narabedla Ltd (1988) and the sharply pointed The Day the Martians Came (fixup 1988). Homegoing (1989) is a more romantic and light-hearted story of confrontation between humans and aliens. The World at the End of Time (1990) recalls the theme of Land&#039;s End in presenting a human colony&#039;s encounter with a godlike Alien in a tale which traverses aeons to the time and location referred to in the title; while the novella Outnumbering the Dead (1990) focuses on the predicament of a man who is among the very few who age and die in a world of youthful-seeming immortals (> Immortality). The late Eschaton sequence - comprising The Other End of Time (1996), The Siege of Eternity (1997) and The Far Shore of Time (1999), all three assembled as The Eschaton Sequence (omni 1999) - places in a complex Space Opera arena a war between two Alien civilizations, each guilty of attempting to enslave Homo sapiens; a flattening of affect can be detected at points, but the action is densely deployed, and Pohl&#039;s demonstration of his comprehensive grasp of the tropes of sf is often masterful. This easy mastery is not always fully engaged in O Pioneer! (October-December 1997 Analog; 1998), set on a colony planet inhabited by (in all) five Alien races, with political Paranoia rife and justified; nor in All the Lives He Led (2011), set in a radically changed Near Future 2079, some time after a volcanic Disaster has destroyed America as a country. The young American protagonist - an indentured servant performing ancillary functions in Vesuvius as the two thousandth anniversary of the explosion of Pompeii nears, and elsewhere in the transformed Middle East - is reminiscent of the street-wise entrepreneur of George Alec Effinger&#039;s more engaging Marid Audran: Budayeen sequence, and contemplates international terrorism (> Politics; Religion) from an emotionally distant remove.\nPohl was president of the Science Fiction Writers of America 1974-1976 and president of World SF 1980-1982. Much insight into the early days of his career is provided by the commentary in The Early Pohl (coll 1976), much of which was subsequently incorporated into The Way the Future Was: A Memoir (1978). The special September 1973 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction was devoted to his work. In 1993 he was given the SFWA Grand Master Award; in 1998 he was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame; in 2009 he received the Eaton Award for life achievement; and in 2010 he won a Hugo for best fan writer, honouring him for his blog, &quot;The Way the Future Blogs&quot; (see links), which comprises short reminiscences of his own life, separate pieces on writers he had known over his long career, and cultural and political commentary from a moderate left position. Like Brian Aldiss, and for even longer, he served his chosen field as ambassador to the wider world; for half a century he and Aldiss were the central men-of-letters of sf.

Asprin&#039;s later novels continued to chafe against similar real-life constraints, and it was not until the invention of the Thieves&#039; World universe that he came into his own. The individual volumes in the sequence - a Shared-World fantasy enterprise crafted by a number of writers - were designed by Asprin to comprise a number of stories written (or edited) so that they read as Braids; he may have been the first sf or fantasy editor to create a significant braided anthology or novel. The sequence begins with Thieves&#039; World * (anth 1979) and ends with Stealer&#039;s Sky (anth 1989). Six Graphic-Novel versions of material from the sequence were published, all with Lynn Abbey and Tim Sale, beginning with Thieves&#039; World Graphics 1 (graph 1985), #2 (graph 1986) and #3 (graph 1986). Other fantasy sequences include the M.Y.T.H. sequence and the Elfquest sequence).\nSince 1979 almost all of Asprin&#039;s work was fantasy, mostly comic. An exception is his Phule&#039;s Company sequence - beginning with Phule&#039;s Company (1990) and ending with Phule&#039;s Company #5: No Phule Like an Old Phule (2003) with Peter J Heck - which deploys the eponymous passel of ragbag soldiers in a Space-Opera universe. A more recent series, Wartorn, begins with Wartorn: Resurrection (2005) with Eric Del Cario. Asprin&#039;s reputation lies mainly in the ingenuity of his braiding activities as editor, but his comic fiction was craftsmanlike.

Occasionally the reader gains sight of repulsive sects who decayedly parody twentieth-century movements - Ecology, for instance - that were betes-noires of the author, who was not averse to polemical intrusions which have not perhaps worn very well, though he did not utter the full-blown Survivalist doctrines adopted by writers who followed him.

As far back as I can remember I&#039;ve always made art - it runs through my father&#039;s side of the family for at least the last several generations. I finally got serious about it in my mid/late twenties, and spent four years at the Atlanta College of Art, concentrating on painting and printmaking on my way to becoming a sculptor. Go figure, huh?\nScience Fiction and Fantasy have been lifelong interests, along with mythology and medieval history, Egyptian, Celtic and Viking art, dinosaurs and the natural world in general. I&#039;m a sucker for word plays and puns - the more atrocious the better - and I&#039;m drawn to layered works, the kind that yield their secrets a few at a time, giving you something new each time you visit. I like Disney, Kay Nielsen, Edmund Dulac, Ivan Bilibin, Wyeth and Beardsley and Cicely Mary Barker, early Picasso and Winslow Homer, Deco and Nouveau - it&#039;s potentially an endless list, and somewhere or other they all probably figure into what I enjoy doing. \nIf there really are such things as previous lives, I think I might have been Japanese once, and/or Irish.

Cornell Importers in St Paul; Scottish clan badges and kilt pins for Dunedin Scottish; medallions and event badges for the Whitewater Longhunters, a blackpowder re-enactment group in Alabama; prototypes for toy and doll manufacturers; guest presentation pieces for several Science Fiction conventions; and private jewelry commissions. I sculpted for Gallo Pewter for the better part of 20 years, had a short but brief tenure at TSR during their waning days (interesting place), and did pieces for SIAB for several years before settling in with 4C Collectibles. Along the way I&#039;ve done a little bit of book and magazine illustration, had a short-lived career writing columns for a local newspaper - I was sort of the token liberal, and a short story of mine was included in the NAMELESS PLACES anthology from Arkham House. Even masqueraded as an Irish folksinger for a while with a friend. We called ourselves Gilhooley and Schwartz. Chris was the talent there. On a good night I soared to the heights of mediocrity.

He began publishing sf stories with &quot;A Gun for Grandfather&quot; for Future Science Fiction in Fall 1957 - a story which appears in Getting Home (coll 1987) - but he did not become active until the early 1970s. He attended the Clarion Science Fiction Writers&#039; Workshop in 1972, at which point he went freelance as a writer, publishing short fiction frequently, and beginning his career as a novelist with the Space-Opera Demu series about a hijacked human, Barton, and his war against the Alien Demu: Cage a Man (1974) and The Proud Enemy (1975), both assembled with &quot;The Learning of Eeshta&quot; (September-October 1973 If) plus the book-length &quot;End of the Line&quot; as The Demu Trilogy (omni 1980). The first, superior, instalment is particularly effective in its depiction of Barton&#039;s imprisonment and eventual escape. Busby&#039;s second sequence, which shifted tone and protagonists over the years, began with Rissa Kerguelen (1976) and The Long View (1976), which two were actually a single extremely long novel and were republished as such, reset and with minor revisions, as Rissa Kerguelen (1977; vt 3vols as Young Rissa [1984], Rissa and Tregare [1984] and the original second volume, The Long View [1984]). Ambitious, and featuring a rather diffuse character portrait of its female protagonist to justify its length, the Rissa Kerguelen story is, in essence, a stylistically awkward tale of bureaucratic oppression on Earth, flight to the stars, interstellar conflict and eventual revenge. The rhythm picks up somewhat but the portents of significance tend to fade in later volumes, which sooner or later connect with the earlier tale: Zelde M&#039;Tana (1980), which is something of an offshoot, and the Bran Tregare/Hulzein Dynasty novels, about Rissa&#039;s eventual husband: The Star Rebel (1984) and Rebel&#039;s Quest (1985), both assembled as The Rebel Dynasty, Volume I (omni 1987), and Alien Debt (1985) and Rebel&#039;s Seed (1986), both assembled as The Rebel Dynasty, Volume II (omni 1988).\nTwo late singletons were of interest. The Breeds of Man (1988) is a serious attempt to deal imaginatively with AIDS, though with a perhaps exaggerated belief in the ethical pureheartedness of the international bioconglomerate called Phoenix where much of the action takes place; driven by a domineering magnate (on lines made familiar by Robert A Heinlein), the folk at Phoenix generate a succession of world-changing solutions to the original problem. It is clear throughout that Busby himself advocates the enablement of human breeding. Altogether more lightheartedly, The Singularity Project (1993) interpenetrates a detective plot into an sf disquisition of Matter Transmission. Busby&#039;s last sequence, the Slow Freight books beginning with Slow Freight (1991) (see Checklist below), expands the implications of Matter Transmission congenially into Space Opera, with Aliens and Sex and more.

Williamson was born in Arizona and raised (after stints in Mexico and Texas) on an isolated New Mexico homestead, and spent his last decades as well in New Mexico; he described his early upbringing and his first encounter with sf in the 1920s in his introduction and notes to The Early Williamson (coll 1975), which assembles some of the rough but vigorous stories he published 1928-1933; and amplified this material in Wonder&#039;s Child: My Life in Science Fiction (1984), which won a 1985 Hugo. These reminiscences reconfirm the explosively liberating effect early Pulp-magazine sf had on its first young audiences, especially those who like Williamson grew up in small towns or farms across an America hurtling out of its rural past.\nAfter discovering Amazing Stories, and specifically being influenced by its 1927 reprint serialization of A Merritt&#039;s The Moon Pool (stories 22 June 1918, 15 February-22 March 1919 All-Story Weekly as &quot;The Moon Pool&quot; and &quot;The Conquest of the Moon Pool&quot;; fixup 1919), Williamson immediately decided to try to write stories for that magazine. His first published fiction, &quot;The Metal Man&quot; in December 1928 for Amazing, was deeply influenced by Merritt&#039;s lush visual style, but like most of his early work conveyed an exhilarating if sometimes unhinged sense of liberation. Williamson was from the first an adaptable writer, responsive to the changing nature of his markets, and his collaborations over the years seemed to be genuine attempts to learn more about his craft as well as to produce saleable fiction. His first great teacher after Merritt was Miles J Breuer, whom he came across through his early association with fan organizations like the International Science Correspondence Club and the American Interplanetary Society, and to whom he deliberately apprenticed himself. Breuer, he reported in The Early Williamson, &quot;taught me to curb my tendencies toward wild melodrama and purple adjectives&quot;; what Williamson gave Breuer in return was an inspiring fount of energy, and both of their book collaborations - The Girl from Mars (1929 chap; exp vt as coll The Prince of Space/The Girl from Mars 1998) and The Birth of a New Republic (Winter 1931 Amazing Stories Quarterly; 1981 chap) - were written primarily by the younger man, following Breuer&#039;s ideas.\nWilliamson&#039;s development was swift. From the very first he was equally comfortable with both story and novel forms; indeed, by 1940 he had published as many as twelve novels in the magazines (the total varying according to estimates of the length thought necessary for a tale to be so designated), including The Alien Intelligence (July-August 1929 Wonder Stories, with two shorter stories as coll 1980 chap [but large pages]); The Green Girl (March-April 1930 Amazing; 1950); The Birth of a New Republic (Winter 1930 Amazing Stories Quarterly; 1981) with Miles J Breuer; &quot;The Stone from the Green Star&quot; (October-November 1931 Amazing); Golden Blood (April-September 1933 Weird Tales; rev 1964); &quot;Xandulu&quot; (March-May 1934 Wonder Stories), &quot;Islands of the Sun&quot; (September-October 1935 Astounding); &quot;The Blue Spot&quot; (January-February 1937 Astounding) and The Fortress of Utopia (November 1939 Startling; 1998); and in his later career he concentrated even more heavily on longer forms. Some of these tales - perhaps most noticeably The Green Girl and Golden Blood - display a crude narrative brio, adaptability to various markets, vivid characters, and inklings of higher ambitions. His output over the first decade of his career fills the first five of the eight volumes of The Collected Stories of Jack Williamson, which includes the novel-length tales; the sequence begins with The Collected Stories of Jack Williamson, Volume 1: The Metal Man and Others (coll 1999) and ends with The Collected Stories of Jack Williamson, Volume 8: At the Human Limit (coll 2011), all expertly edited by Stephen Haffner.\nThe best of his pre-World War Two work was probably the Legion of Space series, which initially comprised The Legion of Space (April-September 1934 Astounding; rev 1947) and The Cometeers (coll 1950); for a breakdown of Legion of Space titles, including The Queen of the Legion (1983), a very late and significantly less energetic addendum, see Checklist. The series depicts the far-flung, Universe-shaking, Space-Opera adventures of four buccaneering soldiers. Giles Habibula, the most original of the lot - whose character interestingly harks back to Rabelais and to William Shakespeare&#039;s Falstaff - became a frequently used model for later sf life-loving grotesques, including Poul Anderson&#039;s Nicholas van Rijn. More or less unaided, they save the human worlds from threats both internal and external in conjunction with the woman whose hereditary role it is to guard from evil a doomsday Weapon called AKKA. The influence of E E &quot;Doc&quot; Smith&#039;s Lensman saga can be felt throughout; and Williamson&#039;s relative incapacity to impart a sense of brute scale was perhaps balanced by a very much greater gift for characterization. Of equal interest, perhaps, was the Legion of Time (a sequence not connected to the Legion of Space) assembled as The Legion of Time (coll 1952; vt Two Complete Novels: After World&#039;s End; The Legion of Time 1963), containing The Legion of Time (May-July 1938 Astounding; cut 1961) and After World&#039;s End (February 1939 Marvel Science Stories; 1961). In one of the earliest and most ingenious Time Operas, involving complex Time Paradoxes and other turns, conflicting Alternate Worlds battle through time in an extensive and complicated Changewar, each trying to ensure its own existence and deny its opponent&#039;s; the fulcrum around which the conflict wages, the moment where one or another world is made possible, focuses on John Barr, who as a small boy either picks up a magnet, whose influence upon him makes the world known as Jonbar possible, or picks up a pebble, fades into obscurity, and the world known as Gyronchi is made possible. A fulcrum of this nature has come commonly to be known as a Jonbar Point, and eventually inspired one of the most penetrating studies yet written about a pulp-sf novel, Brian W Aldiss&#039;s &quot;Judgement at Jonbar&quot; (Spring 1964 SF Horizons).\nBy the 1940s, however, John W Campbell Jr&#039;s Golden Age of SF had begun, and Williamson was suddenly an old-timer. All the same, though he did not much participate in its inception, he did adapt to the new world with commendable speed, and by the end of the decade had published what will probably remain his most significant work, becoming recognized during this period as one of the central authors of Genre SF. A transitional series - the Seetee Antimatter tales - came first: Seetee Ship (July and November 1942, January-February 1943 Astounding; fixup 1951) and Seetee Shock (February-April 1949 Astounding; 1950), both published as by Will Stewart; they were assembled as Seetee Ship/Seetee Shock (omni 1971; vt Seetee 1979), and designed to be read in the original magazine order. In the sequence, the world is confronted with the engineering challenge of coping with the Antimatter that is found to make up part of the Asteroid belt, and harnessing it as a safe Power Source; more smoothly told than its predecessors, the series still unchallengingly presents its asteroid miners and their crises in the old fashion, with a great deal of action but little insight. Its success led to Williamson&#039;s creation of a Comic strip, Beyond Mars, which ran for three years in the New York Daily News.\nFar more significant was Darker Than You Think (December 1940 Unknown; exp 1948), a remarkable speculative novel about lycanthropy and other forms of Shapeshifting which early presented the thesis that Werewolves are genetic throwbacks to a species cognate with Homo sapiens (> Supernatural Creatures). Also in the 1940s Williamson published his most famous and respected sequence, the Humanoids series: &quot;With Folded Hands . . .&quot; (July 1947 Astounding), The Humanoids (March-May 1948 Astounding as &quot;. . . And Searching Mind&quot;; rev 1949) - both assembled as The Humanoids (coll of linked stories 1980) - &quot;Jamboree&quot; (December 1969 Galaxy) and The Humanoid Touch (1980) (for further details see Checklist). Once again early in the genre&#039;s timetable of speculative insights, the series confronted the near impossibility of assessing the pluses and minuses of a humanoid (i.e., AI-driven) hegemony over the world, however benevolent. In The Humanoids itself it is suggested that humanity&#039;s new masters, driven by their Prime Directive, are contriving to force people to transcend their condition; in The Humanoid Touch this ambiguity is lost for, at the end of the Galaxy, long hence, the euphoria induced by humanity&#039;s keepers is impossible to perceive while being presented as mandatory.\nIn the early 1950s - at a point when younger writers in the field were thinking of him as an old master from the beginnings of genre time - Williamson began to suffer from a writer&#039;s block which he did not fully escape for more than two decades, though he continued to produce novels of interest like Dragon&#039;s Island (1951; vt The Not-Men 1968; exp as coll Dragon&#039;s Island and Other Stories 2002), whose presentation of Genetic Engineering once again conceals a prescient numeracy under a bluff, slightly archaic narrative style. Much of his new work from this point was collaborative, and the continued modernizing of his techniques and concerns can be seen as an ongoing demonstration of his remarkable willingness to learn from the world and from others. Star Bridge (1955) with James E Gunn was no more than competent Space Opera, but Williamson&#039;s ongoing partnership with Frederik Pohl was of more interest, though always problematic: the effects of their collaboration did not seem entirely comfortable. Their first sequence, the Jim Eden series of juveniles - Undersea Quest (1954), Undersea Fleet (1956) and Undersea City (1958), all three assembled as The Undersea Trilogy (omni 1992) - was routine. The second, the Starchild tales - The Reefs of Space (1964), Starchild (1965) and Rogue Star (1969), assembled as The Starchild Trilogy (omni 1977) - also fails to combine space opera and Metaphysics convincingly as it traces the problematic epic of humanity&#039;s Evolution into a mature planet-spanning species (> Living Worlds). The Cuckoo series - Farthest Star (fixup 1975) and Wall Around a Star (1983), the latter two assembled as The Saga of Cuckoo (omni 1983) - does not quite succeed in bringing to life its cosmogonic premises or its Linguistic concerns. On the other hand, Land&#039;s End (1988) is an enjoyable singleton, featuring a planet-threatening Disaster: a comet destroys the ozone layer and humanity seeks refuge Under the Sea. The Singers of Time (1991) about a non-violent Invasion of Earth, is also strong.\nIn the 1950s Williamson embarked on a second career at Eastern New Mexico University, where he took a BA in English and an MA with an unpublished 1957 thesis, &quot;A Study of the Sense of Prophecy in Modern Science Fiction&quot;; he then took a PhD with the University of Colorado in 1964 on H G Wells&#039;s early sf, and expanded his thesis into H.G. Wells: Critic of Progress (August 1967-August 1969 Riverside Quarterly; 1973), a book which, despite some methodological clumsiness, valuably examines Wells&#039;s complex engagement with the idea of progress and of the World State. He taught the modern novel and literary criticism until his retirement in 1977, being at the same time deeply involved in promoting sf as an academic subject (> SF in the Classroom). In 1973 Williamson received a Pilgrim Award for his academic work relating to sf.\nIn the meanwhile he began slowly to enter the Indian summer of his writing career, though novels like The Moon Children (1972) and The Power of Blackness (fixup 1976) are surprisingly insecure and the series continuations (see above) lack the force of their models. It seemed that his old age would demonstrate his slow - even though technically productive - decline. But The Best of Jack Williamson (coll 1978) again demonstrated his early strengths, and although Brother to Demons, Brother to Gods (coll of linked stories 1979) was weak, in the 1980s Williamson began to produce work of an astonishing youthfulness. Manseed (1982) uses a space-opera format to investigate, with renewed freshness, the imaginative potential of Genetic Engineering. The Lifeburst sequence - Lifeburst (1984), an exercise in interstellar Realpolitik, grim and engrossing in its depiction of the parcelling out of Earth, sophisticated in its presentation of sexual material; and Mazeway (1990), which has a Young Adult tone through its vivid presentation of the eponymous galactic test that the young protagonists must pass to render humanity eligible for higher things - were various and astonishingly vigorous. Firechild (1986) generates a rhetoric of Transcendence - very much in the fashion of the 1980s - out of developments in Biology. Into the Eighth Decade (coll 1990) serves as a brief resume of Williamson&#039;s post-World War Two career. Beachhead (1992) describes an expedition to a Mars according to contemporary knowledge, although the plot itself is redolent of a much earlier era. Despite its title, Demon Moon (1994) is also - highly coloured - sf, though the tone is Equipoisal between sf and fantasy. The Black Sun (1997), on the other hand, mixes Hard SF and Space Opera: a human Starship is caught by a Black Hole, and discovers artefacts hinting at a Forerunner civilization; and Terraforming Earth (2001), which won a John W Campbell Memorial Award, reworks the concept of Terraforming from the Seetee sequence (Williamson is credited with coining the word in 1949). He continued as well to publish short fiction of merit, &quot;The Ultimate Earth&quot; (December 2000 Analog) winning Hugo and Nebula awards for best novella; and (though he continued to publish through 2007) supplied a touching coda to his long career with The Man from Somewhere (October/November 2003 Analog; 2005 chap), a tale whose title deliberately echoes that of The Girl from Mars, his first separate work, seventy-six years earlier.\nIn 1976 he was given the second SFWA Grand Master Award (his sole predecessor was Robert A Heinlein); in 1994 he received the World Fantasy Award for lifetime achievement. He was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame on its inauguration in 1996. He was an sf writer of substance for over seventy years, as commemorated in Seventy-Five: The Diamond Anniversary of a Science Fiction Pioneer - Jack Williamson (coll 2004) and in The Worlds of Jack Williamson: A Centennial Tribute (1908-2008) (coll 2008) In his work and in his life he encompassed the field. For many, his death served as a symbolic marker of the end of the twentieth century genre, which began when he began.

      "name": "C. J. Cherryh",
      "bio": "C. J. Cherryh is the working name of US writer Carolyn Janice Cherry, who taught for some years (1965-1976) before becoming a full-time writer; she is the sister of David A Cherry. Since 1976 - when she won the John W Campbell Award for most promising writer - she has produced more novels than stories, publishing several before her first story, the Hugo-winning &quot;Cassandra&quot; (October 1978 F&SF). Eventually she accumulated enough short fiction to publish The Collected Short Fiction of C J Cherryh (omni 2004), comprising Sunfall (coll 1981) and Visible Light (coll 1986) plus 16 further stories, one - &quot;MasKs (Venice)&quot; - newly written for the collection. Her first novel was Gate of Ivrel (1976), initiating the Morgaine series - continued in Well of Shiuan (1978) and Fires of Azeroth (1979), the trilogy being assembled as The Book of Morgaine (omni 1979; vt The Chronicles of Morgaine 1985), and the much later Exile&#039;s Gate (1988) - a romantic Heroic-Fantasy quest epic whose interplanetary venue and underlying rationality prophetically underpin a hectic and perhaps rather florid imagination.\nIn all her work - which runs a gamut from Shared-World fantasies to Hard SF - an almost unfailingly creative tension can be sensed between argument and fantastication; and her underlying instinct for construction was confirmed in the late 1980s by a retroactive and ongoing coordination of more and more of her work - singletons and series both - under the aegis of her sf-grounded Alliance-Union Future History, which embraces most of the home Galaxy through the third and fourth millennia, during which period the Alliance, structured around the Merchanter cultures which operate the huge interstellar freighters necessary for trade, manages to survive at the heart of the more ruthless, expansionist Union. A third force whose influence is felt throughout human space is Earth itself, hugely populous, dominated by aggressive supra-planetary corporations, still the heartland of Homo sapiens, though under increasing stress as the expanding sphere of human endeavour inevitably passes beyond her sphere of influence. As Cherryh has herself stated, the various tales in the variously interconnected series are meant to be read separately, though each volume is intended to maintain a reasonable consistency with the overall history; in any case, her default narrative strategy - her narratives are usually non-omniscient, being restricted to the point-of-view of third-person protagonists - generates a continuing sense that there is always more untold in an Alliance-Union novel than that novel could possibly reveal.\nUnusually, the sequence is not planet-based, much of the significant action of the central texts taking place in artificial environments, including a wide variety of spaceships, Merchanter freighters (each huge vessel housing an autonomous culture), satellites, waystations and self-sufficient habitats. The &quot;Gehenna Doctrine&quot;, which prohibits the cultural contamination of newly discovered planets and therefore serves as a vital structuring device for the series, justifies the focus of those central texts while at the same time - for the Doctrine is often honoured in the breach - providing an enormously malleable frame: thus highly disparate tales may be fitted into the overarching sequence - almost to the point where singletons with no apparent connection to the sequence, including some Planetary Romances, might still be thought to belong within the whole because their isolation from any other book proves that the Gehenna Doctrine is working.\nThe Alliance-Union structure, though rough at the edges, serves primarily to hold and sort background material - a necessary aid for an author whose better work almost invariably offers too much material, too many Alien races intersecting too complexly for easy comprehension, a stricture true even of early novels like Hunter of Worlds (1977), in which three cultures express themselves in harrowing detail in too few pages; a sense of bustling, impatient cognition pervades the otherwise garish tale of an alien mercenary race fatally involved with Homo sapiens. But with her second series - The Faded Sun: Kesrith (February-May 1978 Galaxy; 1978), The Faded Sun: Shon&#039;jir (1978) and The Faded Sun: Kutath (1979), all three assembled as The Faded Sun Trilogy (omni 1987) - the Alliance-Union dichotomy, here presented late in its history when the antipathetic Union has begun to seem more attractive, works to order the profusion of material. Unlike the great majority of sf writers, the most consistent complaint about her work must be that individual stories are too short, though the Merchanter novels, which are perhaps most central to the overall series, use their galactic space-based venues with considerable skill to articulate busy narrative lines. Along with Heavy Time (1991) and Hellburner (1992), a twenty-fourth-century pre-Alliance series that currently, in terms of internal chronology, kicks the entire sequence off, these novels - Downbelow Station (1981), which won the 1981 Hugo, Merchanter&#039;s Luck (1982), Cyteen (1988; vt 3vols as Cyteen: The Betrayal 1989, Cyteen: The Rebirth 1989 and Cyteen: The Vindication 1989), which won the 1988 Hugo, plus Tripoint (1994) and Finity&#039;s End (1997) - are perhaps her best and most central work, generating a remarkable sense of the living density of space-born life. Cyteen is a book of enormous girth set on the intricate Union home planet and dense with speculative plays on genetics (> Clones), identity, family and power; plus the claustrophobic but enthralling Rimrunners (1989).\nClosely associated with these books in tone and hard-edged complexity are Alliance-Union novels like Serpent&#039;s Reach (1980), Wave without a Shore (1981), Port Eternity (1982), Forty Thousand in Gehenna (1983) and Voyager in Night (1984). The Chanur Saga, made up of The Pride of Chanur (1982; text restored 1987), Chanur&#039;s Venture (1984), The Kif Strike Back (1985), all three assembled as The Chanur Saga (omni 2000); plus Chanur&#039;s Homecoming (1986) and Chanur&#039;s Legacy (1992), another deft and crowded depiction of alien psyches in a complexly threatened interstellar venue, has also been fitted into the overall series. Late in order of publication but in effect a two-part prequel to the entire project, Heavy Time (1991) and Hellburner (1992), both assembled as Devil to the Belt (omni 2000), concisely and intensely compresses the early Merchanter years into a kind of closet drama set like Rimrunners (see above) in Cherryh&#039;s favourite setting: the interior of a ship. As the years have passed, individual stories within the structure have tended, very roughly, to shift their concern from honour (a focus typical of the &quot;shame cultures&quot; found in preliterate societies on Earth and endemic to much Space Opera) to the responsibilities of power (a problem central to literate &quot;guilt cultures&quot;).\nThe lineaments of the Alliance-Union series remain unclear, but it seems increasingly the case that the novels incorporated within this loose mosaic - running from effective singletons to close argued subsequences - are Cherryh&#039;s central achievement. Even the later, polished Foreigner sequence - comprising Foreigner: A Novel of First Contact (1994) (> First Contact), Invader (1995), Inheritor (1996), Precursor (1999), Defender (2001), Explorer (2002), Destroyer (2005), Pretender (2006), Deliverer (2007), Conspirator (2008), Deceiver (2010) and Betrayer (2011) - owes any underlying security of worldview to the fact that it fits into the Alliance-Union remit; the same seems true of the weaker Gene Wars sequence comprising Hammerfall (2001) and Forge of Heaven (2004). The sense grows that for Cherryh the Universe, and everything imaginable within its particoloured quadrants, continues both evanescent and full of marvel; and that sentient species must revere whatever habitats remain to them after the terrible years of species growth and species destruction hinted at in those books set early in the Universe. It is a vision which, after so many busy books will take some time to settle, though within terms she has already cued us to anticipate.\nThere are several fantasy singletons and series, the most notable of the latter being the Rusalka books beginning with Rusalka (1989).

Depending on how you count, somewhere between 65 and a couple hundred books by me have come out from major publishers. I would rather be a moderately successful lawyer with a less interesting background. Jo and I are still married. We have one son (Jonathan) and one grandson (Tristan).

Edwards, Ian R. Jamieson, Josephine Kains, Jillian Kearny, Howard Lee, Zeke Masters, Frank S. Shawn, and Joseph Silva.\nGoulart&#039;s first professional publication was a 1952 reprint of the SF story &quot;Letters to the Editor&quot; in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction; this parody of a pulp magazine letters column was originally published in the University of California, Berkeley&#039;s Pelican.

In the early 1960s, Goulart wrote the text for Chex Press, a newspaper parody published on Ralston Purina cereal boxes (Wheat Chex, Rice Chex, Corn Chex). He contributed to P.S. and other magazines, along with his book review column for Venture Science Fiction Magazine. Cheap Thrills: An Informal History of the Pulp Magazines (1972) is his best known non-fiction book.\nGoulart&#039;s fiction is characterized by several themes, notably humor, technology gone wrong (usually through incompetence rather than malice) and heroes with superhuman powers. His humorous crime and science fiction includes tales about robots and historical Hollywood figures, such as Groucho Marx. In the 1970s, he wrote several novels based on Lee Falk&#039;s The Phantom for Avon Books, using the pseudonym &quot;Frank Shawn&quot; (a play on his wife and son&#039;s names). He has also written comic book stories and short stories about The Phantom for Moonstone Books from 2003 to present.\nIt is widely known that Goulart ghost wrote the popular TekWar series of books credited to the actor William Shatner (Shatner is said to have written the outlines for the books).

The Plot: When Stephen Silk is sent to the planet of New Texas, he thinks he&#039;s being sent to do three small things: Take over for the recently assassinated ambassador from the Solar League (and find out who did it while he&#039;s there), convince the fiercely independent world to join the Solar League, and head off a potential alien invasion. When he arrives, however, he quickly finds himself in the midst of a culture that guards its freedoms jealously, which puts a bit of a twist on the investigation. Can Silk stand before the Court of Political Justice and convince the tribunal that the victim being a politician isn&#039;t an acceptable defense against murder? Can he unmask the killers and reveal the conspiracy that motivated them? And just how insulting is it that the new ambassador is packing heat?\nThe reading will be <em>The Scouring of the Shire</em> by J. R. R. Tolkien, adapted by Cyd Hoskinson and Nancy Skidmore. The Plot: The movies directed by Peter Jackson were sweeping epics that captured the feel and the peril of Middle Earth, but audiences can only sit still for so long. Come hear the vital parts of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; that were never filmed, much less reached the cutting room floor. In this installment, we find out that even after the fall of a great evil, there can still be wickedness in the hearts of men, wizards, and hobbits alike, and that it will be up to a new breed of hero to keep the peace at the end of the Third Age.",

Michaux received her M.Ed. in School Counseling from Auburn University; after working as a school counselor in a Richmond public school for four years, she gleefully quit her job in order to attend Virginia Commonwealth University, earning an MA in Writing and Rhetoric, then an MFA in Creative Writing. Going back to school to study writing and literature felt like winning the lottery&mdash;highly improbable and incredibly lucky. During this period Michaux was privileged to edit, transcribe and annotate a group of letters by the writer Peter Taylor, written to his friend John Thompson, then editor of the <i>New York Review of Books</i>; she was also the first recipient of the David Baldacci Fiction Fellowship. Currently an Assistant Professor of Focused Inquiry at VCU, Michaux is working on a new novel entitled <i>Prime Mover</i>, a historical fantasy about Eleanor of Aquitaine as a sorceress, with a sorcerer lover as her raison d&#39;etre. Her scholarly work is published in the International Journal of Higher Education; she has fiction in <i>Millennium</i> and <i>Trust and Treachery: Tales of Power and Intrigue</i>, and is a regular reviewer for <i>Blackbird</i>, VCU&#39;s journal of literature and the arts.",

Educated in the classics and foreign languages since boyhood (Latin, Greek, Arabic, and Russian), he studied mechanical engineering at California Polytechnic (Pomona, B.S. 1986), with emphases in robotics, machine design, optical physics, and Soviet studies; as well as earning a masters in national security studies (San Bernardino, Special M.A., 1988). He worked his way thru school dealing blackjack and craps among other things, and spent one delightful summer in Army Basic Training (where else can you shoot a machine gun and *they* pay *you*?). He designed industrial robotics systems at the Douglas Aircraft Company (1987-1991) in Los Angeles, and pursued research in artificial intelligence at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (1987). After the Cold War ended, he founded the Ultimax Group, Inc. (1992-present), a Russian-American company in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Ultimax specializes in nothing, but over the years has engaged in: nuclear science, systems engineering, and transmutation; military robotics; international trade; Russian space software publishing; countercracking and network security; and scenario-based studies on various strategic topics, e.g. space affairs, energy, arms control, missile defense, infrastructure security, and pandemics. As ASMEs 1994 Congressional Fellow, he spent his year working for the Subcommittee on Space in the U.S. House of Representatives, during which he developed legislation; wrote White Papers; prepared expert witnesses; and advised Members on Russian affairs, Space Station, Milstar, civil/military convergence, participated in the First Interstellar Robotics Conference at NYU, and was a technical consultant on Deep Impact (Paramount/Dreamworks major motion picture released May 8, 1998). He was instrumental in the evolution of Presidential Decision Directive 23: Commercial Remote Sensing Policy. He is a published commercial artist and author (nonfiction), and has written about space-based solar power, shell worlds, climate change, linguistics, energy parks, biofuels, and energy security. In 2011, he co-organized and sponsored the First Tennessee Valley Interstellar Workshop in Oak Ridge, lectured on geoengineering in Moscow for the Russian Academy of Sciences / Rosgidromet (their national weather service), and also at the International Academy of Astronautics in Aosta, Italy. His work has also appeared in /Journal of the British Interplanetary Society/, /Acta Astronautica/, the /Whole Earth Review/ and a cover story on Soviet Star Wars in the Smithsonian /Air & Space/ magazine. He has patents and trademarks pending for a number of optoelectronic, robotic, security, and space system inventions as well as the concept of Tetrageneration(TM). He serves as a volunteer in Oak Ridge city government as vice-chair of the Environmental Quality Advisory Board, which was tasked by City Council to formulate the City&#039;s green energy policy, and initiated the policy decisions to authorize photovoltaics in the City and institute single-stream-recycling-with-rewards, first in the Southeast to do so. He is a former adjunct member of ASMEs Government Relations Committee; past-chair of the Oak Ridge Section as well as the Technology & Society Division; and currently sits on the Society&#039;s National Energy Committee, tasked with writing Energy Talking Point papers for the 112th Congress.",

The Reinhardt Legacy Fight Team started years ago as a casual group that regularly met with Hank at his house in Stone Mountain, GA during the 90s to spar. Later, some original members were in the Museum Replicas Ltd. Fight Team when he was director of MRL. Our purpose was to perform in sparring demonstrations. Two members have been in Hank's videos \"Viking Sword\" and \"Myth of the Sword\" as actors. Hank is gone now, but the friends Hank brought together have formed a team to promote \"The Book of Swords\". This final book has been published posthumously by his family. We use the Gray Wolf as our logo in honor and memory of Hank. This was his heraldic device when he was active in the formative years of the SCA in the southern US. He was a key founder in the movement in the South. Later in life he went on to train and advise in print, video, and demonstrations. He was a key figure in launching the current, almost mainstream level of interest in swords in North America by being the first to provide usable arms that the average enthusiast could afford. Hank opened his home and knowledge to us in our youth. We are not unique in this, many people who knew Hank have had similar experiences. We are continuing to entertain, inform, spar, cut, and test new theories. We demonstrate the use of classical weapons with cutting demonstrations and full contact sparring. Hank's philosophy was that fighting for your life requires ruthless efficiency. Our group has an aim at realism, eclipsed by needs for safety. Fairness does not figure in this equation. This attitude is out of keeping with some sport fighting organizations, but Hank was adamant about learning to fight, not learning sport. We do not promote any culture, era, or weapon above others. We evaluate the weapons and methods based on utility. Testing them in the contexts they were conceived, and in hypothetical situations, both modern and ancient. Hank loved to experiment and designed several fantasy swords that have no historical counterpart, but are very funtional. Hank enjoyed innovating new techniques with ancient weapons as well as taking what was useful from historical fechtbooks, but always with an eye for the practical. This was life and death afterall.

While there Minz worked in a wide variety of capacities--mostly as an editorial assistant, literary agent and packager of anthologies, including co-packager of the highly regarded annual The Year's Best Fantasy and Horror edited by Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling.\n\nIn September 1997, the siren song of the New York City publishing scene was simply too strong to resist, and he joined the editorial staff of Tom Doherty Associates (i.e. Tor, Forge, Orb, etc.) as David Hartwell's assistant. After several years of working on way too many books in way too small a window of time, he had accumulated enough of a list of his own authors to justify his very own job as a full Editor. Coffee, cake and scotch ensued. After those were all gone, there was nothing left to do but join the other German publishing empire, so on January 31, 2005, Herr Minz joined the editorial staff of Del Rey Books of the Random House Publishing Group (i.e. he moved from Holtzbrinck to Bertelsmann). After a couple years with the largest publishing company in the US, it was time to move on.\n\nSo on the centennial of Heinlein's birth, Minz joined Baen Books as Senior Editor. And he has been there ever since...\n\nAuthors he has worked with include Catherine Asaro, Larry Correia, Hal Duncan, Eric Flint, Terry Goodkind, Elizabeth Haydon, Nancy Kress, Mercedes Lackey, Elizabeth Moon, Frederik Pohl, John Ringo, Robert J. Sawyer, Travis S. Taylor, Harry Turtledove, Vernor Vinge, David Weber, Jack Williamson, Gene Wolfe, and Timothy Zahn, among many, many others.\n\n\nFor more information, here is a link to an interview:  https://www.baen.com/Interviews/intMinz It’s a bit long on the tooth, but still mostly true…",

From that one difference, he sought to extrapolate rapid changes in technology and society that would lead to something recognizable as steampunk, while entertaining the reader by telling an engaging story with a memorable cast of characters.",

One day I made a friend on one of those online games with chat that turned out to be screenwriter and movie director Derek Milton. He and I became great friends and after a few weeks of talking. He gave me a couple of his screenplays to read and I was hooked. I knew at that point I wanted to try writing. After days of not being able to come up with a story to write, I had a dream of three teens on another planet and in a cave. That was it; I knew what had to be done.

He first learned to read on his own at the age of ten and was allowed to join his classmates in middle school. His struggles with reading left him without any ability to explore the world inside books like other readers. This gave him a drive to explore worlds in his mind. He loved to look at comic books and make up his own stories, which eventually led to him becoming a storyteller. Most of his life was spent as an artist, mostly a painter. For years he told his stories with a brush, unable to write his stories with the skill they required. As he got older, technology caught up with his disability. He was finally able to tell his stories and put them on paper with the help of speech to text software. This is when he wrote his first book, unpublished.

      "bio": "Let me tell you a little bit about the genesis of <strong>Chance Fortune</strong> and, by proxy, a little bit about myself... I remember first becoming excited about books as a student in South Pittsburg Elementary School. The schools annual book fair was one of my favorite events. Mom or Dad would eat lunch with me and then buy me a book of my choosing! Wizard and Warrior: choose your own adventure was always a favorite of mine. I just loved those Joe Jusko covers! It was while attending South Pittsburg Junior High that I finally decided to pluck several books in Edgar Rice Burroughs Mars series down from my Dads bookshelf to read. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. It was the first time a book totally transported me to another world! I even faked being sick to stay home from school to finish one of them, Gods of Mars, I believe. I also encountered other masters of science fiction during this time, such as Ray Bradbury and Madeline LEngle. Sadly enough, my enthusiasm for books subsided while attending South Pittsburg High School. I was too busy flirting with girls and playing football. But even then, it wouldnt have been an odd thing if youd caught me reading a Stephen King short story collection or a Dean Koontz paperback. My primary creative outlet then was drawing, brought on by my love of comics. Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, John Buscema...those guys were rock-stars to me! During this time I crafted a few comics (on legal pads) starring superhero versions of my brothers Daniel and Joseph, and myself, which I still have today. Despite the crude venue, one can see even in these early works that I already understood the basic principals of storytelling. It was during my latter years attending Middle Tennessee State University that I rediscovered, or rather, was rescued by, literature. Although I was surrounded by friends, it was a dark and lonely time in my life. One day when I was feeling especially down, on a whim, I picked up the audio book version of Stephen Kings Desperation, as read by Kathy Bates. It was ERBs Mars all over again! I was swept away to a fantastic world...one that was violent and scary, but also full of love and self-sacrifice. I immediately began devouring every Stephen King novel I could get my hands on. Through Mr. Kings works, I discovered countless other authors who I came to adore. I began reading anything and everything from the latest bestseller to the ageless classics I should have read in my youth. I continued this trend after moving and taking a job in Chattanooga, TN, where I currently live. It was during my early years here that masters of fantasy such as Tolkien, Pullman, Gaiman, and, of course, Rowling became my teachers and entertainers. A few years after the turn of the millennium, I decided to try my own hand at writing short stories for publication. My first efforts were atrocious, and received many deserved rejection letters. But I kept plugging away, and eventually began receiving both compliments and suggestions from magazine editors...although none of them were willing to publish my work. And frankly, the short story market simply isnt what it used to be. I realized if I were ever going to see major publication, I needed to write a novel. I began work on a horror novel that never quite gelled. Frustrated, I began searching my brain for a new idea. And then like a lead cannon ball covered in cement, it hit! What if I crafted a novel that turned the mythic chosen one cliche on its head? What if I created a protagonist who had no divine gifts but acted the hero regardless? What if I created a hero who had no higher destiny, but seized one anyway? What if I created a hero anyone of us could be with enough determination and elbow grease? The result was <strong>Chance Fortune</strong>.",

      "name": "Kurt Miller",
      "bio": "<u>Kurt Miller, in his own words:</u><i>\r\nMost of my life was spent in Maryland and was raised near the Chesapeake Bay. There were troubled times in my early school days due to my addiction to drawing and my dyslexia, which affected my reading writing and speech. I drew through some of the most boring lectures in school and on anything with a blank space big enough, like books, napkins, notepads inside and out, and my walls at home, which later caused my parents to designate a wall for drawing on. Through the first to second grade my teachers really thought my constant drawing during class would disrupt my future education and never realized the true problem lay with my dyslexia. I later found out that the school would report to my family that my future, at best, would be a janitor mopping floors. My parents refused to believe this and found a program specialized to help children with dyslexia. Through the rest of my elementary studies I stayed with a small group of classmates and managed to befriend a school mate who I could draw with at lunchtime or after class. Later Star Wars became a fascination I shared with my new school mate, whom I would compete with to see who could draw the best Star Wars characters.\r\nDuring high school there were many things that distracted me from my drawing, girls and sports became more of my focus, but I missed out on all the extra art programs. I only realized in my last year of high school that I knew art would be my future. \r\nSo my parents helped me create my portfolio for college submission and if I didn&#039;t get a scholarship I knew college would be a long and expensive task. My first step was to attend a multi school portfolio review. My goal was to try to attend Rhode Island School of Art or Maryland Institute College of Art, which unfortunately gave me a somewhat poor review, and which killed any possibility of winning any kind of scholarship. My father and I made a last desperate attempt at editing my portfolio on the spot to take out much of the cartoon Conan sketches and show the more unique silkscreen painting.  Ironically, I really didn&#039;t like it as much and hid it away from most reviews, but it won me an acceptance at a two-year private school, Maryland College of Art and Design with awards and scholarships. \r\nMCAD is a small school but I learned a lot as they were determined to get us few artists accepted to the bigger schools for continued education.  After two years I won another scholarship to one of the schools that had turned me down two years earlier: Maryland Institute College of Art and after 3 more years I graduated with Award of Merit in Illustration.  \r\nWhile in school, I was offered several non-paying internships but I needed to support myself and didn&#039;t accept. After I graduated, I found myself doing landscaping and retail work and trying to find freelance work on the side. I look back now and see how crude my work and ad promos were but it was good that I learned my lesson then rather than later. I remember working at Borders Books and shelved all those great books by Jim Burns, Michael Whelan, Ken Kelly, Easley and Larry Elmore and imaging myself sharing the shelf with these awesome artists.  It was both frustrating and motivating -and so I would go home every evening after work and paint into the wee hours . \r\nMy luck started to change in &#039;94 when Avalon Hill wanted to buy one of my military pieces of Rommel the &quot;Desert Fox&quot; which they saw on a promo sheet I sent out...although it was &quot;only&quot; meant to hang on a wall as decoration for the CEO, not as a game cover. \r\nNow that I had their attention and found that they were big on military art for their war game products I started to research the subject more and painted pieces that would later get my foot in the door for an interview that gained me a position later that year. The pay wasn&#039;t great plus it was a work for hire contract, but what mattered more to me was exposure, published work, and commercial art experience, and it also allowed me to indulge my other passion, gaming. \r\nAvalon Hill is where I truly perfected my commercial art skills. They promoted me to their lead illustrator and allowed me to taake full control of illustrating game packages such as &quot;Advance Squad Leader,&quot; &quot;Diplomacy,&quot; &quot;Machiavelli,&quot; &quot;Hannibal,&quot; &quot;Successor,&quot; &quot;Titan Arena&quot; and &quot;Age of Renaissance&quot;.  Four years later a group of employees got together to form a computer game company called Talonsoft. \r\nFor much of that year I turned them down, as I was a bit intimidated by the computer and felt that I wouldn&#039;t be much help for them, and, besides, I was enjoying my current job. A co-worker, at Avalon Hill, later encouraged me to look into the computer aspect and introduced me to Bryce 3D and Photoshop. Still inexperienced, but since being in-house gave me security and allowed me to learn, I began producing pieces with this new medium. So I saw myself slowly moving away from oil, gouache paint and the airbrush, I quickly became hooked to the computer even after that initial intimidation. I saw things that otherwise would be very difficult to do in a painting or airbrush. This whole new world of working digitally allowed me to experiment with no real risk and allowed me to save this incredible image I created on a single layer. The computer was more fun and much less stressful than an airbrush.  The days of airbrushing I had to cut friskette with a blade only to spray paint underneath because it didn&#039;t stick properly, then to have the air gun spit water from a residue build up onto my nice sky with a water soluble gauche paint, ARRRH, were over. \r\nLater, in 1998 I finally accepted to go on board with the Talonsoft team and later found out 6 months after leaving, Avalon Hill was bought out by Hasbro and all of the staff was let go.  I now really dug in deep with various computer software, like Strata 3D, 3D Max, Adobe Illustrator, in addition to learning new tricks with Adobe Photoshop and mastering my Bryce 3D. I started to play around more with 3D program, which allowed me to rotate my scene and importing figure models to real environment settings.  I was then able to render them to a psd file for that final 2D painting with a Wacom tablet in Photoshop. Now this new method of making art became really fun and working for a game company and seeing your art being played was very rewarding. \r\nTwo years after joining Talonsoft, we merged with Take Two Interactive and I went from in-game artist to their game cover artist and published award winning titles like &quot;East Front,&quot; &quot;West Front,&quot; &quot;Century of War,&quot; &quot;Age of Sail,&quot; &quot;Vietcong,&quot; &quot;Tropico&quot; and &quot;Railroad Tycoon 3.&quot;   \r\nIn 2001 the company started to down size and my own position was being threatened, so once again I started freelancing and distributing promos. By 2003 I was one of the last few to be laid off and that&#039;s when I decided it&#039;s time to be my own boss. \r\nWith a lot of help from my family, we worked on a business plan to incorporate my business to KMI Studio, LLC and took on some reliable clients, which remain to this day. Not committing myself to one genre, I accepted a mix of illustration jobs from book covers to advertisement, greeting cards, editorial for magazines and, of course, the gaming industry. \r\nThe first year of total freelancing was a little shaky and a lot of my salary went towards advertising on the web and to the directories. Eventually, the workflow was non-stop with about 12-15 book covers alone in a single year with Baen Books. I&#039;ve also worked with others in the book industry like Simon and Schuster and Bookspan and I was accepting editorial pieces just about every other month with National Geographic, The Military Officer magazine and computer covers for Activision, EA, ID and 3D Realm and if a day or two open up I&#039;ll fill those in with some work for the greeting card industry.  Additionally, I have created board game pieces for Fantasy Flight, Hasbro, Triking Games, Multi-Man Publisher, Valley Games, GMT Games and the new Avalon Hill. This eclectic mix of clients has kept me on my creative toes.  \r\nThe small breaks I get between jobs are the times I attend conferences where I meet with all kinds of fascinating customers and other artists to share quality moments with. The small lists of cons I attend every year are Balticon, WBC, Gencon, Libertycon and Origins. Some of the conventions I aspire to attend are Spiel in Essen Germany, Worldcon and Dragoncon.  \r\nI believe the only time I&#039;ll slow down on the commercial stuff will be when I&#039;m at the retiring age.  A small part of me still misses that oil paint smell so I may some day go back to paint in oil for myself, oh yes, and for my significant other of course. Maybe something else very cool will pop up for the artist to play with in my lifetime. I can not wait.\r\n</i>To view Kurt Miller&#039;s stuff please go to www.kmistudio.com ",

A visit to the Mission San Luis Rey in California in 2001 and subsequent research became the catalyst to write her first novel, My House of Dreams, which was published in 2010. That was followed by her first science fiction novel, The Mendel  Experiment (through World Castle Publications), in 2015. A sequel, Blue Fire, came out in 2015 and the latest Mendel book, Power Stone of Alogol, was published in 2017. \n\tThe author earned her Bachelorâ€™s degree in English and a Masterâ€™s degree in Instructional Media at Utah State University. She has worked in public school libraries for over thirty years, most recently in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Ms. Kite has been married to the love of her life for almost 40 years.

He became a writer and game publisher, proving that college can be very valuable as long as you don&#039;t let classes get in your way.\r\nHe has survived involvements with the Republican Party (alternate delegate to the 1972 convention, but he got better - he now considers himself a small-l libertarian), the SCA (former landed baron and National Chronicler) and law school (escaping before the bar exam; game design was more fun).\r\nSteve&#039;s first professional design work was for Metagaming, which published his Ogre, its sequel G.E.V., Melee, Wizard, and several other games. In 1980, Steve bought the rights to Ogre and The Space Gamer magazine from Metagaming and started his own company. That company, Steve Jackson Games Incorporated, is now 30 years old and employs more than 20 people.\r\nOne of the first releases on the SJ Games label, Raid on Iran (1981), was a critical and sales success. The next year, SJ Games released its first big hit, Car Wars . . . followed shortly by Illuminati.\r\nHe&#039;s still writing games. Some of the high points:\r\n<ul><li>In 1983, Steve was elected to the Adventure Gaming Hall of Fame.</li><li>In 1984, he tried his hand at interactive books or &quot;game novels.&quot; His first one, Scorpion Swamp, was published by Penguin and spent six months on the British children&#039;s bestseller list.</li><li>1986 saw the launch of GURPS, the &quot;Generic Universal Roleplaying System.&quot; As of 2010, the GURPS system - now in its fourth edition - has won a number of awards and is still being supported with new releases.</li><li>In 1990, SJ Games made national news when it filed suit after a destructive raid by the Secret Service. The SS agents, in search of &quot;hackers,&quot; nearly forced the company out of business by seizing hardware and data files. With the help of the newly formed Electronic Frontier Foundation, SJ Games took the case to federal court, proved that the raid had been unjustified and improperly executed, and won more than $50,000 in damages. The EFF remains active to prevent similar abuses.</li><li>In 1994, Steve reworked the old faithful Illuminati to jump on the trading-card bandwagon. INWO (Illuminati: New World Order) became the company&#039;s first million-dollar preship.</li><li>In 2001 came Munchkin, which started as a silly card-game parody of a dungeon crawl and grew into the biggest hit we&#039;ve ever had. For the next few years, most of his creative effort went into Munchkin sequels and supplements.</li><li>In 2009, Steve created two quick dice games, Zombie Dice and Cthulhu Dice. Both were hobby hits which made it onto mass-market shelves . . .and sold more than any other non-Munchkin release that year.</li></ul>\r\nSteve is a dedicated SF reader and fan, and enjoys attending both gaming and SF conventions. He writes filksongs (adequately) and sings (very badly). His other interests include gardening (especially water gardening), Lego, pirates, trains, beekeeping, dinosaurs and tropical fish. In his copious free time, he looks at webcomics, eats, and sleeps.\r\n\r\n(Taken from Mr. Jackson&#039;s <A HREF=&#039;http://sj.sjgames.com/sjbio.html&#039;>Personal Bio Page</A>)",

Born in Tennessee, Jonathan began reading comics at an early age. (Conan the Barbarian Annual #11 was his first.) His love of fiction, folklore and by-gone days was further fueled when his family relocated to the United Kingdom. At the age of nine, Jonathan found himself crawling over castle ramparts, visiting old churchyards and getting neck strain marveling at towering cathedrals. He returned to the U.S. as a teenager where he survived parochial school and a rebellious year in New York City (where he unknowingly met his future wife), before earning his degree from Brevard College in the captivating wilds of Western North Carolina. Like many fantasy novelists, he originally developed his magical setting of Autumn&rsquo;s Fall as a backdrop for the roleplaying games he ran for his friends. After submitting his creations to a once-mighty RPG company, he received an offer to purchase his intellectual property. Ultimately, he chose to keep his brainchildren close to home and began writing the Autumn&rsquo;s Fall novels in earnest.His greatest literary influences are Robert E.

I had the Rocky Mountains in my backyard, and I got to see the &quot;summer of love&quot; through the eyes of an eleven year old in a college town. I watched Lost in Space in the third grade, when G.I. Joe was new, and Star Trek after that. Ray Harryhausen&#039;s movies were favorites. Science Fiction and Fantasy consumed my childhood. In my teens I discovered Tolkien&#039;s Lord of the Rings, and Dungeons and Dragons not long after. I&#039;ve been Role-Playing since 1977.  As an adult I became fascinated with Mythology, particularly transformative mythology and the hidden meanings of Myth. Joseph Campbell is my guru.  Google him.\nI started drawing before I can remember. One of my earliest childhood memories is of sitting on my dad&#039;s lap as he drew funny cartoon animals for me. Throughout my childhood I drew, and wrote stories, and combined stories and pictures in comic books of my own making, for my own entertainment.\nAfter High School, I attended the Colorado Institute of Art in Denver. It was primarily a design school, but they taught all of the important basics. I worked in advertising for fourteen years. Toward the end I began to plot my escape--Iwould either get a better class of work, or I would hang up my brushes and get a real estate license. Fortunately (or unfortunately?) for me, I got a better class of work.\nIt was at conventions, especially Dragon Con, that I met the people who would open the door for me. One thing led to another, and suddenly I was moving my family to Illinois, across the border from Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, where I was the newest member of TSR&#039;s art staff. It was a skinny little window of opportunity that opened for the briefest moment. I dived through.\nLater, Wizards of the coast bought TSR and moved us to Washington State.\nIt was here in Washington, that my work began to really excel. Designing the look and feel of Third Edition Dungeons and Dragons was one of the high points of my professional career. How could I possibly have more fun than designing dragons for D&D?  I am very lucky, and very happy in my work.\nWashington became my children&#039;s &quot;home town,&quot; and honestly--I love it here.\nIn 2000, Hasbro bought Wizards of the Coast and at the end of 2002, dispensed with their art staff. One of the new CO&#039;s was heard to say that &quot;fantasy artists are a dime a dozen.&quot; Ouch.\nIn 2003 I released my first art book, Transitions, from Paper Tiger. The Tiger went belly up not long after my book released, and so it is difficult to find.\nSince then I&#039;ve been freelancing, doing work for publishers and gaming companies and for private commissions. I did twenty-plus covers for R.A. Salvatore&#039;s Drizzt books, for C.J. Cherryh, Tad Williams, Marie Brennan, and others. In the last few years my old story-telling muse was reawakened. I&#039;ve sold short stories, and am working on a novel for DAW Books, to be released in May of 2016. There are other projects in the works, including another art book.\nStick around--the best is yet to come.",

Taking an avid interest in taking astronomy to the public, he held a national office as the South Eastern Regional Director of the Astronomical League (S.E.R.A.L) for six years.  Today he holds the title of â€˜Master Astronomerâ€™ by the Astronomical League, one of some 160 world-wide.  Over the course of several years, Mr. Sacco developed a chapter of Astronomy at the Charlie Elliott Wildlife Management Area.  The Chapter today has grown to over 60 members and hosts regular public viewing events.\nPhilip takes an unusual approach to astronomy with the public, preferring naked eye observing and the re-telling of the tales represented in the heavens.  His entertaining â€˜Walk-n-Talksâ€™ are a treat for all.  He is well known as a Mythologist able to weave the convoluted stories of the ancients in an entertaining and educational way.  He also has a penchant for mixing science fact with science fiction in his â€˜after midnightâ€™ talks.\nA profoundly spiritual individual, Mr. Sacco is a recognized speaker on spiritual warfare, having written a book on the topic entitled â€˜Awaken the Warrior.â€™  His book is a multi-discipline study of the armor of God, breaking each piece down Biblically, historically as well as psychologically.

Having started with a 2000 year old Roman recipe he researched some 33 years ago, today he teaches how to make and appreciate this age old golden elixir.  His technique is unique and of his own creation, breaking many conventional â€˜rulesâ€™ to derive a delicious and reproducible product he labels by the name â€œRoman Daze Meadery.â€  \nFor a truly intoxicating experience, one must join Mr. Sacco for a mead tasting and witness his skills with sleight of hand as he practices One Magical Knight weaving lessons of the Spirit with his spirits.

After barely graduating from Calvin College in 1992 with a philosophy degree, he was fired from a variety of jobs before moving to California, where he stumbled into software development. As this job required neither punctuality nor a sense of direction, he excelled at it. In 2009, he called upon his extensive knowledge of useless information and love of explosions to write his first novel, Mercury Falls. Since then, he has written nine more novels, including Starship Grifters, which Hugh Howey called his &quot;favorite read of 2014.&quot; Rob has just signed a contract with Thomas Dunne for a near future sci-fi comedy/thriller titled The Big Sheep. He is currently working on Disillusioned, the sequel to his humorous fantasy epic Disenchanted.",

As the autoharp-playing half of the Brobdingnagian Bards, Gunn and partner Andrew McKee developed a following with weekly performances on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin. This led to gigs at renaissance faires, science fiction conventions, and Celtic music festivals as well as parties and weddings for the pair. The group headlined at the Oscar party for The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. With the Bards&#39; calendar busy, Gunn began producing the duo&#39;s recordings. His first solo album, Soul of a Harper, appeared in 2004; he then embarked on work for Irish Drinking Songs for Cat Lovers. The Brobdingnagian Bards band broke up amicably on September 15, 2008, and Gunn plans to pursue a solo career. After the Brobdingnagian Bards disbanded, Gunn began releasing several albums a year with four full-length studio albums released in 2008, three in 2009, and two in 2010. He is also involved in an online resource called the Celtic MP3s Music Magazine. The weekly publication reviews Celtic music of all varieties from Irish traditional music to Celtic rock. Two free, full-length MP3s are offered for download every week on the site. Marc is one of the few professional podcasters producing five different podcasts each month, the most-popular being the Irish &amp; Celtic Music Podcast. Additionally, Gunn publishes The Bards Crier&#39;s Music Marketing and Promotion Tips Ezine, a newsletter that teaches musicians about marketing and promotion, and handles webmaster duties for a variety of sites including the Austin Celtic Association. Due to his hard work as a podcaster and promoter of independent Celtic music, he has earned the nickname of &quot;The Celtfather&quot; from his fans. It is claimed that more than five million MP3s have been downloaded from him; over one million of those were for &quot;Tolkien (The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings).&quot; The Brobdingnagian Bards were voted &quot;Best Renaissance Men&quot; in the Austin Chronicle&#39;s 2003 Best of Austin poll. In March 2005, The Bards collected an Austin Music Award for the Bards as Best Novelty Band, the first time any Celtic band has won. Gunn&#39;s solo CD Soul of a Harper won the Best Cover Art category that year. In 2007, they continued that honor by winning Best None of the Above Band, and in 2008, they won Best Folk Band.",

The mechanism of his defection was enlisting into the Army in 1974 at age 17, which deeply distressed his high school (Boston Latin, founded 1635) as they thought he had \"higher and better things\" ahead of him. He served two years as an enlisted grunt with the 101st Airborne and one and a half with the 193rd Infantry Brigade in Panama, getting 2 years of college done in the process (when he wasn't in the field he was taking courses). At that point the Army gave Kratman a scholarship and sent him off to Boston College to finish his degree and obtain a commission. Tom graduated, cum laude, in 1980 and returned to the Army as an infantry officer. Tom served another three year tour in Panama, then more schooling at Benning, then 4+ years with the 24th Infantry Division near Savannah, Georgia. Fun times then ceased for a while, while he did two years in Recruiting Command. Saddam Hussein (UHBP) rescued Tom from this by invading Kuwait. He has been told that he was the only captain to actually escape from USAREC for the war. Tom arranged a transfer to Special Operations Command and went through the active part of the campaign attached to 5th Special Forces. He continued slurping at the Army trough until it became painfully clear that the bottom had dropped out of the militantly and violently aggressive anti-communism market and that he was not going to like the rather PC direction the Army (which was, arguably, the only thing he ever selflessly loved) was heading in. Among other things, Tom earned a Combat Infantry Badge and the Ranger Tab. Tom got out in 92 and went to law school. He hated it but was far too pig headed to quit. He became a lawyer in 95 and quickly realized that what he had felt about law school was but a pale shadow of true hate. Stayed in the Reserves and took every tour he could to avoid practicing law. And when the reserves had nothing interesting there was MPRI (\"white collar mercenaries R us\"). Saddam Hussein (UHBP) once again stepped to the fore and saved Tom from the continued practice of law. In February of 2003 the Army called him up to participate in the invasion of Iraq. Still, God has a sense of humor. While awaiting a flight over Tom was informed he had a 100% blockage in his right coronary artery (imagine his chagrin) and wasn't going anywhere fun anytime soon. Instead, he spent eight months stuck at Fort Bragg, then a few in the DC area, before finally being sent on to be on the faculty of the Army War College as Director, Rule of Law, for the US Army Peacekeeping and Stability Operations Institute. Keep in mind that divine sense of humor previously mentioned. Tom retired in 2006, bored out of his gourd and finally ready to admit his love affair with the Army was over. He's returned to Virginia and, instead of practicing law, writes full time for Baen, Castalia, and Defy Media. (That means, NO, don't ask for legal advice because there's no more confidentiality with him. He's outa da bidnez.) His books published to date include Countdown: The Liberators, Countdown: M Day, Countdown: H Hour, Caliphate, A State of Disobedience, A Desert Called Peace, Carnifex, The Lotus Eaters, The Amazon Legion, Come and Take Them, and The Rods and the Axe. His collaborations with John Ringo include Watch on the Rhine, Yellow Eyes, and, The Tuloriad. Tom's married to a (really beautiful) girl from rural western Panama. He and Yolanda have 3 children and 3 grandchildren. Yoli and Tom make their home in Blacksburg, VA. His next book, A Pillar of Fire by Night, via Baen, is scheduled to be released on 23 October, 2018.\"",

Not just with your insane writing schedule, not just with all of the convention travel, not just with your sometimes . . . questionable sense of humor, but with you? What do you say about your closest confidante, your most trusted critic, the person whose opinion means more to you than any other opinion in the world? What do you say about the woman who's helped you raise your kids, who's driven them to soccer practices -- three consecutive hours of soccer practices, two nights a week -- and sat in the car waiting for them so that you could stay home and write?\nWhat do you say about someone who is the most important person in your life?\nI suppose I could start by telling you that she's 5'1\" . . . on a tall day. That she's Irish, which means that without SPS 9000 sunscreen her skin starts smoking in indirect sunlight. That she's had seven spinal surgeries, but she's still upright. That she doesn't think she's anything special, but then, she's not always the best judge of character. That even though neither of us is perfect, I can't imagine anyone else with whom I'd rather share my life, who would enjoy the good times with me more, or would be there so solidly when life hits a wall.\nThat I love her and that she plans to marry me all over again next April. (Assuming, of course, that she doesn't decide to shoot me in the meantime.)\nAll of that is true, but it's still sort of pecking around the edges of everything Sharon is. She has a sense of humor, she puts up with my sense of humor, and when I first met her she was working in a bookstore, helping push science fiction to the poor addicts. She got me invited to my first signing. She called me up the day my first book arrived and said \"David, guess what! Your book's here, and we've already sold half of all the copies we got!\" \"Great!\" I said. And \"Should I save the other one for you?\" she asked innocently. I was a \"special guest\" at Dragoncon, and she explained to our table at the banquet \"Yes, David is the Special Guest. There are special Olympics, special people . . . .\" She's the Grand Duchess of Montana to The Royal Manticoran Navy. She's the person people come to when they need to tell me something or ask me something and they don't want to intrude on my writing time. She's the official Keeper of the Calendar, who gets not just me but our entire family where it needs to be and when it needs to be there. She is She Who Must Be Obeyed in Greenville, and the center of my universe.\nShe is the extraordinary woman I was lucky enough to find and who suffered a momentary lapse in judgment and fell in love with me. Would the books have been written without her? Probably. Would they have been written in such number? Probably not. Would they have been written with as much joy? Never. Would they have been as rich and as vibrant without her as my sounding board, the first critical editor of my ideas? Not in a million years.\nHer Grace of Montana is the love of my life and the reason I am who I am, and the world would be a sadder, emptier, incredibly less joyous place without her in it.\nDavid Weber",

      "bio": "Born and raised in Arizona, Kevin Hearne attended college at Northern Arizona University, earning a degree in English Education. It was during this time that he first got the writing bug, thanks to Ken Kesey's <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</i>. He worked for the college newspaper both as an editorial cartoonist and as a feature columnist, and started a novel that he never finished. He taught high school English for three years in California before returning to teach in Arizona.\nHearne decided to try an epic fantasy. He wrote for three years and came up with 200,000 words or so, which turned out to be a bit long for an unknown author's debut. He chopped it down and sent off a 114,000-word version to some agents, who all rejected it, but he also sent it to one publisher, who replied after only two weeks that it had passed the \"first round\" and would get passed on to other editors soon. No other word came for many moons and he began to work on something else while he waited. Kevin had an idea for a web comic featuring a Druid who could communicate mentally with animals, especially his own hound. Zuda.com was running a contest, and he scripted out eight pages and completed six of them before realizing that if he submitted his work, DC would own a piece of the characters, or maybe own them outright. He didn't want that, because he liked these characters too much to share with anyone else. So he wrote a novel about Atticus and Oberon instead, and it turned out to be great fun and easier to write than anything else he'd tried before. He finished writing <i>Hounded</i> in eleven months, and still hadn't heard back from the publisher about his epic fantasy.\nHe sent out a round of twelve queries and got some nibbles, but all ultimately rejected him. He tweaked his first chapter for the twentieth time, revised his query letter, and sent out another round of twelve queries. He got some more nibbles, more rejections, but also an offer of representation from Evan Goldfried at Jill Grinberg Literary Management.\nEvan sent <i>Hounded</i> to nine publishers on September 9, 2009, along with teasers for the next two books in the series. Inside of two weeks, four of those publishers bid on the book at auction, and one of them, ironically, was the same publisher who had been sitting on his epic for a year.\nHearne wrote <i>Hexed</i> in five months and <i>Hammered</i> in six to accommodate the back-to-back release schedule.\n\n<I>(From Mr. Hearne's page on <A HREF='http://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Kevin-Hearne/biography.html'>Fantasy Book Review</A>)</I>",

      "bio": "<i>At an early age it was pretty apparent that drawing was what I was good at. I spent nearly all of my spare time drawing my favorite cartoon characters with my older sister. We would draw them on rolls of butcher paper, sometimes larger than ourselves, challenging ourselves with the days-long task of coloring the entire image. Three years my elder, and much better at art than me, my sister instilled in me an intense passion to improve.\nBy my teenage years my love of drawing attracted me to comic books, a passion I still hold dear. I spent every cent of my allowance on those artists I admired so much. I would emulate their work, redrawing all of my favorite panels, and often times created my own comic book characters and stories. By this point, I was certain that I was going to be an artist when I grew up. My parents, however, took a little more convincing.\nMy local high school sponsored a program called \"Careers in Art\" which I was immensely fortunate to attend. The program placed students in a weekly internship with a design company or working professional. It was through this program that I met my long time mentor. Through him I learned the basics of illustration, and thus decided to choose that as my major when I would enter college.\nI attended the School of Visual Arts in New York City from 1996-2000. Having only done one painting prior, it was there that I honed my picture making skills and came to love the traditional art of oil painting. I graduated the top of my class with a B.F.A. degree in Illustration, and received that year's 'Rhodes Family Award for Special Achievement' in my major.\nAfter graduation, with some scholarship money in my pocket, I embarked on what would quickly turn into my career. I started by painting portraits out of my parent's basement. Eventually, I was making enough to rent a studio. I found a gallery to represent my fine arts, and starting pursuing my dream of becoming an Illustrator. More than a decade later, and with more than a hundred published covers to my name, I am still consumed by that childhood passion to improve.</i>\nDan dos Santos' work spans a variety of genres, including novels, comics and film. He has worked for clients such as Disney, Universal Studios, Boeing Aircraft, Saatchi & Saatchi, Scholastic Books, The Greenwich Workshop, Penguin Books, Random House, Tor books, UpperDeck, Wizards of the Coast, Dark Horse Comics and DC Comics.\nDan has been the recipient of many awards.

Instead of doing what a normal author-to-be would do and write stories, Jon wrote for his school newspaper and told stories through the medium of running role-playing games for his friends.\nJournalism helped pay the way through college, and gaming garnered him lifelong friends. After college, journalism didn't pan out as a career, but Jon continued creating worlds and forging stories with his friends.\nFast forward almost thirty years; Jon is still a gamer who every now and then dabbles with writing. A long-time friend and fellow gamer who had found success as an author, Mark Wandrey, convinced Jon to submit a short story for an anthology. Jon's story was accepted, and it gave him the impetus to finish his first novel, A Reluctant Druid.\nLiving in Indianapolis, Jon still games, and continues to write. You can find out more about Jon at jonrosborne.com. Fans who sign up for his mailing list will receive Chapter 0 for A Reluctant Druid and be the first to here news about Jon's newest books and stories.",
