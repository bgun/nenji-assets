Any spot in my school notebooks that didn&#039;t have notes were filled with sketches. I drew mostly from the D&D adventures that my brother ran, as well as the fantasy books I was reading. I did a few pieces based on Terry Brooks&#039; Shannara series, but focusing on being a nerd, I didn&#039;t have much time for art in high school.\nWhen I got to college I dual majored in Computer Science and Art History. I minored in Studio Art, and took as many art classes as my schedule allowed. I seemed to be pursuing a career in art or art education, but decided to try graduate school in Computer Science. I graduated in 2004 with a Master&#039;s in CS, but again switched paths and returned to my art interests. Mike, my brother, and I co-own Aradani Studios, a costuming and art company that we founded in 2002. We travel mostly in the Southeast United States, to various conventions and Renaissance Festivals, selling our art, and our ears.\nI currently call Nashville, TN my home, and don&#039;t see that changing for quite some time. This is where my friends, my family, and my career is. When I first posted this bio, I said that, &quot;I still have no idea what I want to do with my life.&quot; Well, in those 4 years that I wrote that, I think I have found my calling. At the age of 26, I won the most prestigious fantasy art award there is, the Chesley Award. Mike and I have slowly but steadily grown this business into something that now employees other people! And most importantly, I love what I do, and I truly enjoy being able to talk about my art with people, and have a dialogue with them.&quot;\n",

He is a Professor at a medical school where his research focuses on the hippocampus and memory. While his history since he entered university was confirmed, there have been some suspicions about his origins before that. Rather, it is suspected that he was genetically created in a growth vat and raised by hyper-intelligent rats to study and understand the human brain with an eye towards world domination.\n\n\"Speaker\" is known for his eagerness to educate others. For example: hosting educational Scotch tastings at conventions, consulting for numerous authors on matters pharmaceutical, biological, and neurological; and writing nonfiction essays (as Tedd Roberts and now under his own name; found at WWW.BAEN.COM - Free Library, Nonfiction 2012- 2018) on matters of science in science fiction. He educates others through convention appearances, his previously mentioned essays and blog. Among all of these endeavors he has also mentored numerous young minds through his involvement with the Boy Scouts of America and by offering advice to up and coming researchers and grad students. \n\nDr. Hampson is also known for his research, and due to this, is suspected to be one of the most likely causes of any future zombie apocalypse ... whether it would be because of a lab \"accident\" or because his curiosity on its effectiveness, is still hotly debated. Simultaneously, his professional alter ego has been considered to be one of the most likely to find a cure for any zombie apocalypse, although some suspect he already has one waiting \"just in case.\" In either (or both) cases it is suspected that Speaker will also be available to provide expert commentary.\n\nKnown for his high level of involvement in many activities, some suspect that Speaker has either cloned himself, or developed a treatment allowing him to no longer require sleep. Unhappy with his low level of productiveness (compared to the other personalities, not normal humans) he recently started writing short stories and YA novels. Amongst his three busy lives he found time to marry and help raise two sons, study Krav Maga & Pekiti Tiersia Kali, play trombone in a brass octet, and be an active member of his church.\n",

He started writing poetry and short fiction in the fifth grade, and a lifetime of reading, writing, and studying has given him a love of storytelling that clearly shows in his work. In his stories, he creates a consistent and rationally explained technology and society. Even when dealing with fantasy themes, the magical powers are treated like another technology with supporting rational laws and principles. Many of his stories have military, and particularly naval, themes, and fit into the military science fiction genre. He challenges current gender roles in the military by assuming that a gender-neutral military service will exist in his futures. By frequently placing female leading characters in what have previously been seen as traditionally male roles, he has explored the challenges faced by women in the military and politics. His most popular and enduring character is Honor Harrington, whose story, together with the \"Honorverse\" she inhabits, has been developed through nineteen novels, six shared-universe anthologies, a three book young-adult series, and â€œHonorverse historicalâ€ Manticore Ascendant series, written with Timothy Zahn and Tom Pope. To date, David currently has seventy six book titles and twenty one separate series that he has written or co-written. David currently lives in Greenville, SC with his wife Sharon, their three children, three dogs and four cats. You can keep up with David's busy schedule by following his Facebook page, davidweber.net and on Twitter.

During my service I learned new skills, saw interesting sights, and met exotic people who hadn&#039;t run fast enough to get away. I returned to Duke in 1971, completed my law degree, and became Chapel Hill&#039;s Assistant Town Attorney while trying to put my life back together through fiction that made sense of what I&#039;d seen and done in the Army. (It still doesn&#039;t make any sense.) My writing career took off. Since 1981 I have been a fulltime SF and fantasy writer. Depending on how you count, somewhere between 65 and a couple hundred books by me have come out from major publishers.

The Plot: When Stephen Silk is sent to the planet of New Texas, he thinks he&#039;s being sent to do three small things: Take over for the recently assassinated ambassador from the Solar League (and find out who did it while he&#039;s there), convince the fiercely independent world to join the Solar League, and head off a potential alien invasion. When he arrives, however, he quickly finds himself in the midst of a culture that guards its freedoms jealously, which puts a bit of a twist on the investigation. Can Silk stand before the Court of Political Justice and convince the tribunal that the victim being a politician isn&#039;t an acceptable defense against murder? Can he unmask the killers and reveal the conspiracy that motivated them? And just how insulting is it that the new ambassador is packing heat?\nThe reading will be <em>The Scouring of the Shire</em> by J. R. R. Tolkien, adapted by Cyd Hoskinson and Nancy Skidmore. The Plot: The movies directed by Peter Jackson were sweeping epics that captured the feel and the peril of Middle Earth, but audiences can only sit still for so long. Come hear the vital parts of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; that were never filmed, much less reached the cutting room floor. In this installment, we find out that even after the fall of a great evil, there can still be wickedness in the hearts of men, wizards, and hobbits alike, and that it will be up to a new breed of hero to keep the peace at the end of the Third Age.",

While there, he spent most of his time playing wargames and working on the student paper, the Thresher (he spent two years as editor). He became a writer and game publisher, proving that college can be very valuable as long as you don&#039;t let classes get in your way.\r\nHe has survived involvements with the Republican Party (alternate delegate to the 1972 convention, but he got better - he now considers himself a small-l libertarian), the SCA (former landed baron and National Chronicler) and law school (escaping before the bar exam; game design was more fun).\r\nSteve&#039;s first professional design work was for Metagaming, which published his Ogre, its sequel G.E.V., Melee, Wizard, and several other games. In 1980, Steve bought the rights to Ogre and The Space Gamer magazine from Metagaming and started his own company. That company, Steve Jackson Games Incorporated, is now 30 years old and employs more than 20 people.\r\nOne of the first releases on the SJ Games label, Raid on Iran (1981), was a critical and sales success. The next year, SJ Games released its first big hit, Car Wars . . . followed shortly by Illuminati.\r\nHe&#039;s still writing games. Some of the high points:\r\n<ul><li>In 1983, Steve was elected to the Adventure Gaming Hall of Fame.</li><li>In 1984, he tried his hand at interactive books or &quot;game novels.&quot; His first one, Scorpion Swamp, was published by Penguin and spent six months on the British children&#039;s bestseller list.</li><li>1986 saw the launch of GURPS, the &quot;Generic Universal Roleplaying System.&quot; As of 2010, the GURPS system - now in its fourth edition - has won a number of awards and is still being supported with new releases.</li><li>In 1990, SJ Games made national news when it filed suit after a destructive raid by the Secret Service. The SS agents, in search of &quot;hackers,&quot; nearly forced the company out of business by seizing hardware and data files. With the help of the newly formed Electronic Frontier Foundation, SJ Games took the case to federal court, proved that the raid had been unjustified and improperly executed, and won more than $50,000 in damages. The EFF remains active to prevent similar abuses.</li><li>In 1994, Steve reworked the old faithful Illuminati to jump on the trading-card bandwagon. INWO (Illuminati: New World Order) became the company&#039;s first million-dollar preship.</li><li>In 2001 came Munchkin, which started as a silly card-game parody of a dungeon crawl and grew into the biggest hit we&#039;ve ever had. For the next few years, most of his creative effort went into Munchkin sequels and supplements.</li><li>In 2009, Steve created two quick dice games, Zombie Dice and Cthulhu Dice. Both were hobby hits which made it onto mass-market shelves . . .and sold more than any other non-Munchkin release that year.</li></ul>\r\nSteve is a dedicated SF reader and fan, and enjoys attending both gaming and SF conventions. He writes filksongs (adequately) and sings (very badly). His other interests include gardening (especially water gardening), Lego, pirates, trains, beekeeping, dinosaurs and tropical fish. In his copious free time, he looks at webcomics, eats, and sleeps.\r\n\r\n(Taken from Mr. Jackson&#039;s <A HREF=&#039;http://sj.sjgames.com/sjbio.html&#039;>Personal Bio Page</A>)",

Taking an avid interest in taking astronomy to the public, he held a national office as the South Eastern Regional Director of the Astronomical League (S.E.R.A.L) for six years.  Today he holds the title of â€˜Master Astronomerâ€™ by the Astronomical League, one of some 160 world-wide.  Over the course of several years, Mr. Sacco developed a chapter of Astronomy at the Charlie Elliott Wildlife Management Area.  The Chapter today has grown to over 60 members and hosts regular public viewing events.\nPhilip takes an unusual approach to astronomy with the public, preferring naked eye observing and the re-telling of the tales represented in the heavens.  His entertaining â€˜Walk-n-Talksâ€™ are a treat for all.  He is well known as a Mythologist able to weave the convoluted stories of the ancients in an entertaining and educational way.  He also has a penchant for mixing science fact with science fiction in his â€˜after midnightâ€™ talks.\nA profoundly spiritual individual, Mr. Sacco is a recognized speaker on spiritual warfare, having written a book on the topic entitled â€˜Awaken the Warrior.â€™  His book is a multi-discipline study of the armor of God, breaking each piece down Biblically, historically as well as psychologically.

      "name": "Tom Kratman",
      "bio": "Tom Kratman is a political refugee and defector from the People's Republic of Massachusetts. The mechanism of his defection was enlisting into the Army in 1974 at age 17, which deeply distressed his high school (Boston Latin, founded 1635) as they thought he had \"higher and better things\" ahead of him. He served two years as an enlisted grunt with the 101st Airborne and one and a half with the 193rd Infantry Brigade in Panama, getting 2 years of college done in the process (when he wasn't in the field he was taking courses). At that point the Army gave Kratman a scholarship and sent him off to Boston College to finish his degree and obtain a commission. Tom graduated, cum laude, in 1980 and returned to the Army as an infantry officer. Tom served another three year tour in Panama, then more schooling at Benning, then 4+ years with the 24th Infantry Division near Savannah, Georgia. Fun times then ceased for a while, while he did two years in Recruiting Command. Saddam Hussein (UHBP) rescued Tom from this by invading Kuwait. He has been told that he was the only captain to actually escape from USAREC for the war. Tom arranged a transfer to Special Operations Command and went through the active part of the campaign attached to 5th Special Forces. He continued slurping at the Army trough until it became painfully clear that the bottom had dropped out of the militantly and violently aggressive anti-communism market and that he was not going to like the rather PC direction the Army (which was, arguably, the only thing he ever selflessly loved) was heading in. Among other things, Tom earned a Combat Infantry Badge and the Ranger Tab. Tom got out in 92 and went to law school. He hated it but was far too pig headed to quit. He became a lawyer in 95 and quickly realized that what he had felt about law school was but a pale shadow of true hate. Stayed in the Reserves and took every tour he could to avoid practicing law. And when the reserves had nothing interesting there was MPRI (\"white collar mercenaries R us\"). Saddam Hussein (UHBP) once again stepped to the fore and saved Tom from the continued practice of law. In February of 2003 the Army called him up to participate in the invasion of Iraq. Still, God has a sense of humor. While awaiting a flight over Tom was informed he had a 100% blockage in his right coronary artery (imagine his chagrin) and wasn't going anywhere fun anytime soon. Instead, he spent eight months stuck at Fort Bragg, then a few in the DC area, before finally being sent on to be on the faculty of the Army War College as Director, Rule of Law, for the US Army Peacekeeping and Stability Operations Institute. Keep in mind that divine sense of humor previously mentioned. Tom retired in 2006, bored out of his gourd and finally ready to admit his love affair with the Army was over. He's returned to Virginia and, instead of practicing law, writes full time for Baen, Castalia, and Defy Media. (That means, NO, don't ask for legal advice because there's no more confidentiality with him. He's outa da bidnez.) His books published to date include Countdown: The Liberators, Countdown: M Day, Countdown: H Hour, Caliphate, A State of Disobedience, A Desert Called Peace, Carnifex, The Lotus Eaters, The Amazon Legion, Come and Take Them, and The Rods and the Axe. His collaborations with John Ringo include Watch on the Rhine, Yellow Eyes, and, The Tuloriad. Tom's married to a (really beautiful) girl from rural western Panama. He and Yolanda have 3 children and 3 grandchildren. Yoli and Tom make their home in Blacksburg, VA. His next book, A Pillar of Fire by Night, via Baen, is scheduled to be released on 23 October, 2018.\"",

Originally from Houston, Texas, he dutifully followed his parents as they went from there to Hillsboro, Texas, then to Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and finally to Wichita, Kansas. Along the way, they discovered about the only way to keep Rob quiet was to give him a book. Unfortunately for them, it turned out he could read very quickly, so they had to give him lots of books. He latched onto the Hardy Boys series first, then about anything else he could reach. Without books, either he or his parents probably would not have survived. Possibly both. Rob has traveled extensively. Most recently, in 2012, he walked the majority of the Offa&#39;s Dyke Trail along the border of Wales and England. Many experiences on the trail shaped his writing. One might say the Offa&#39;s Dyke Trail led to Edward. He decided to write professionally when he discovered he was too educated for most jobs, and not quite educated enough for a few. Fortunately, he had always written and had always wanted to emulate Forester, Tolkien, Weber, Drake, Parker, Chandler, and Francis. Now he can.",

Not just with your insane writing schedule, not just with all of the convention travel, not just with your sometimes . . . questionable sense of humor, but with you? What do you say about your closest confidante, your most trusted critic, the person whose opinion means more to you than any other opinion in the world? What do you say about the woman who's helped you raise your kids, who's driven them to soccer practices -- three consecutive hours of soccer practices, two nights a week -- and sat in the car waiting for them so that you could stay home and write?\nWhat do you say about someone who is the most important person in your life?\nI suppose I could start by telling you that she's 5'1\" . . . on a tall day. That she's Irish, which means that without SPS 9000 sunscreen her skin starts smoking in indirect sunlight. That she's had seven spinal surgeries, but she's still upright. That she doesn't think she's anything special, but then, she's not always the best judge of character. That even though neither of us is perfect, I can't imagine anyone else with whom I'd rather share my life, who would enjoy the good times with me more, or would be there so solidly when life hits a wall.\nThat I love her and that she plans to marry me all over again next April. (Assuming, of course, that she doesn't decide to shoot me in the meantime.)\nAll of that is true, but it's still sort of pecking around the edges of everything Sharon is. She has a sense of humor, she puts up with my sense of humor, and when I first met her she was working in a bookstore, helping push science fiction to the poor addicts. She got me invited to my first signing. She called me up the day my first book arrived and said \"David, guess what! Your book's here, and we've already sold half of all the copies we got!\" \"Great!\" I said. And \"Should I save the other one for you?\" she asked innocently. I was a \"special guest\" at Dragoncon, and she explained to our table at the banquet \"Yes, David is the Special Guest. There are special Olympics, special people . . . .\" She's the Grand Duchess of Montana to The Royal Manticoran Navy. She's the person people come to when they need to tell me something or ask me something and they don't want to intrude on my writing time. She's the official Keeper of the Calendar, who gets not just me but our entire family where it needs to be and when it needs to be there. She is She Who Must Be Obeyed in Greenville, and the center of my universe.\nShe is the extraordinary woman I was lucky enough to find and who suffered a momentary lapse in judgment and fell in love with me. Would the books have been written without her? Probably. Would they have been written in such number? Probably not. Would they have been written with as much joy? Never. Would they have been as rich and as vibrant without her as my sounding board, the first critical editor of my ideas? Not in a million years.\nHer Grace of Montana is the love of my life and the reason I am who I am, and the world would be a sadder, emptier, incredibly less joyous place without her in it.\nDavid Weber",

Instead of doing what a normal author-to-be would do and write stories, Jon wrote for his school newspaper and told stories through the medium of running role-playing games for his friends.\nJournalism helped pay the way through college, and gaming garnered him lifelong friends. After college, journalism didn't pan out as a career, but Jon continued creating worlds and forging stories with his friends.\nFast forward almost thirty years; Jon is still a gamer who every now and then dabbles with writing. A long-time friend and fellow gamer who had found success as an author, Mark Wandrey, convinced Jon to submit a short story for an anthology. Jon's story was accepted, and it gave him the impetus to finish his first novel, A Reluctant Druid.\nLiving in Indianapolis, Jon still games, and continues to write.

          "description": "<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;\">Future history has long been the realm of prophets, SF writers, and economists alike. Whether history repeats itself or merely rhymes, its ebb and flow may be described by Kondratiev Cycles, Anonymous Conservative's r/K selection theory, or Dr. Jim Penman's Biohistory. How do these historical cycles impact the development of science and technology? Dr. Schantz shows how scientific development oscillates between an Aristotelian phase in which new principles are identified and a Platonic phase in which the implications of those ideas are worked out. Arguing we now stand at peak Platonism, Dr. Schantz explains why he anticipates an imminent swing toward an Aristotelian phase and the profound opportunity this transition offers for lovers of liberty to shape not only culture and politics, but also to predict the future.</span></p>\n",

What is the origin of the \"Jupiter as Cosmic Shield\" myth, and what do modern computer simulations tell us about Jupiter role in Solar System evolution?",
